            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, WHEREIN THE SCOPE, MANNER OF PROCEDING, AND PROFIT OF THIS BOOKE IS DECLARED, REQVISITE TO BE READ BEFORE THE BOOKE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are now diuers years (Gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) ſince I published the firſt parte of the <hi>Prudential Balance of Religion,</hi> in which, by the weights of Prudence and Right Reaſon I weighed together the Catholik and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion according to their firſt Founders in our English nation, to wit, <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Martin Luther:</hi> which booke hath neuer ſince bene anſwered by anie Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant albeit diuers miniſters, and ſuperintendents haue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at it both in Pulpits and printed books, shewing thereby that they wanted no will to anſwere it, if they could haue performed it. In the preface thereof I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a ſecond parte, in which I would after the ſame manner weigh the forſaied religions according to their claimes to the holie Scripture, and the expreſſe words thereof, which here now I offer vnto thee. The cauſes why I haue ſo long differred the publishing of this ſecond par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, are well enough knowne to them who know me, and not needfull to be known of them who know me not. And therfore I will not trouble thee with the rehearshall
<pb facs="tcp:173883:4"/> of them, but here propoſe vnto thee the ſcope, manner of Proceding, and Profits of this ſecond parte.</p>
            <p>2. As a man conſiſteth eſſentially of a Soule and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and can neither be, nor be imagined without them both: So the true Church of Chriſt eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth <note place="margin">Two things wholy neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarieto Chriſts Church.</note> of his true <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which is the forme, and (as it were) the ſoule of his Church, and of <hi>lawfull Paſtors and People,</hi> who teach and embrace his Doctrine, which Paſtors and People make (as it were) the bodie of Chriſtes Church. And without both theſe partes, to wit, Chriſts true <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and true <hi>Paſtors</hi> teaching, and <hi>People</hi> embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it, Chriſts true Church can no more be, or imagined to be, then a true man can either be, or imagined to be, without both the true bodie and true ſoule of a man. And albeit the manifeſt need of both theſe partes to the true Church of Chriſt, doth enforce Proteſtants to make ſome clame to them both, and to pretend that they haue alvaies had both true <hi>Paſtors</hi> who taught, and <hi>People</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiued their Doctrine; yet their pretenſe to this parte of the Church is ſo weake and ſlender, as but ſeldome and vpon mere neceſſitie they inſiſt thereon. But their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt pretenſe and claime is to the true <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt; and think thereby to proue, that they haue alwaies had true <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> who taught and beleiued their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, as I haue shewed in a Booke of the <hi>Author of the Proteſtant Church and Religion;</hi> wherein alſo I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced by ten Demonſtrations, (all taken out of the open Confeſſions of the beſt learned Proteſtants both of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland and other Countries) that they neuer had anie one <hi>Paſtor</hi> who taught, or man who beleived the very funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and moſt ſubſtantiall points of their religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe; but that he was firſt Author, Inuentor, and Father therof, as ſome of them in plaine termes do call him.</p>
            <p>3. And although this Booke haue bene now theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie years published both in Latin and English, and doth by the open confeſſions of the beſt learned Proteſtants
<pb facs="tcp:173883:4"/> ouerthrow the very foundation of their Church, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew, that it hath no foundation at all beſides their owne imagination; yet hitherto no Proteſtant hath made anie shew of a ſolid anſwere vnto it. I ſaie, no shew of a <note place="margin">why D. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux lecture is no anſwer to the Author of Proteſt. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> ſolid anſwere, becauſe that florish which Doctor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux the Kinges diuinitie Reader in Oxford hath made in a lecture, deſerueth not the name of shew or shadow of an anſwer. Firſt, becauſe he nether mentioneth the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of anſwering my ſaied booke, which I ſet downe, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> proue by reaſon, teſtimonie of holie Fathers, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Proteſtants, ought to be kept in anſwering ſuch a booke: And which lawes, I tell him before hand, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he ether keepe, or refute, I would accounte his anſwer no ſolid or lawfull anſwere, but the babling of one who could neither ſufficiently anſwere, nor yet hould his peace. Secondly, becauſe he maketh no other anſwere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the manifold and manifeſt depoſitions of the beſt learned Proteſtants, which I haue my ſelf brought, and clearly confuted by the depoſitions or teſtimonies them ſelues, againſt which confutation of myne, he replieth nothing, but ſtandeth mute. Thirdly, becauſe he ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> mangleth the anſwere which I make to their Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſme, wherewith they by pretenſe of true <hi>Doctrin,</hi> would proue that they haue alwaies had true <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>People</hi> who taught and beleiued it, and ſo pittifully replieth to the ſaied anſwere, as he plainly sheweth him ſelf to be a true Heretike, that is, conuicted in his owne iudgement, as I think euerie one, that compareth his lecture with my Booke, will clearly perceiue.</p>
            <p>4. But ſith the Proteſtants cheife and almoſt whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of the truth and euer being of their Church, is the pretenſe of the truth of their doctrin by the Scripture, I will euidently shew, euen by the light of Reaſon and Prudence, that they haue no reaſonable or colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of Scripture: but that it maketh expreſly, clearly, and directly againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for Catholiks, almoſt in all points of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie. For whereas there be twoe waies to shew, <note place="margin">Twoe waies to proue that. the Scripture is againſt Proteſt.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:173883:5"/> that the holie Scripture is plainely againſt Proteſtants; the one by conferring of diuers places together, by bringing the expoſition of the holie Fathers, decrees of Councels, and tradition of the Church: the other, by onely compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the expreſſe words of Catholiks and Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

The firſt condition is touching the words or letter of the holie Scripture; The ſecond, is touching the ſenſe or meaning of the ſaied words or letter.

            <p>6. The ſecond condition touching the ſenſe is: That <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> 2. <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching the ſenſe, proued.</hi>
               </note> the pure written word of God may iudge betwixt vs according to the pure ſenſe therof, which (when it is ſpoken clearly or of purpoſe to tell: vs what Gods mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is) of it ſelf and according to the vſual acception of
<pb facs="tcp:173883:6"/> men it doth afford, and this is euident alſo eſpeciallie, if the Church muſt not be admitted to be the infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the true ſenſe of Scripture. But neuertheles I proue it. Firſt, becauſe Proteſtants cannot ſet downe anie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> condition which is ſo reaſonable or indifferent to both partes. Secondly, becauſe ether the Scripture in matters of controuerſie clearly declareth her meaning by her ſelf without any help or expoſition of man, or she doth not. If she clearly declare her meaning by her ſelf, then needeth she no help of man at all. For what need she help of others to declare her meaning, who clearly declareth it her ſelf? And vndoubtedly if in any place she clearly declareth her meaning, she doth it in thoſe places, in which she ſpeaketh both clearly, and of ſet purpoſe, for to expreſſe her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But if by her ſelf she doe not clearly declare her meaning in matters in controuerſie without ſome help of man (eſpecially without the help of one of the oppoſite parties who contend about her meaning) certainly she is <note place="margin">A iudge muſt be able by himſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his mynd.</note> not fitt to be the onely iudge of controuerſies, as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants would haue her.

Beſids, if the pure word of God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may not iudge according to the pure ſenſe which of it ſelf it clearly yeeldeth, but according to a different, nay quite oppoſite ſenſe, which being conferred, expounded, wreſted by man, it is forced to yeeld, who shall aſſure vs, that Gods ſenſe, and not the ſenſe of man, whoſe (and not Gods) that conference, inference, and wreſting is, is made <note place="margin">

               <pb facs="tcp:173883:6"/> Let vs ſet aſide a while mens gheſſes or imaginations of the conference or expoſition of this or that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, let vs not bring deceitfull ſcales of mans conference, inference or expoſition of Scripture, with which we may weigh what we will, and how we will ſaying according as we pleaſe: This is the meaning, That is not the meaning; This followeth, That followeth not; This is true, that is falſe, againe all which we may oppoſe thoſe words of S. Auſtin: <hi>This is mans inference, mans conference, mans expoſition, mans gheſse, not diuine authoritie,</hi> and let vs bring the diuine and ſure ſcale of the pure meaning of Gods pure word, and in that let vs weigh the doctrin of both partes, or rather let vs acknowledge that which is weighed and allowed by God him ſelf in this his ſcale. Moreouer, if mans help be neceſſarie to Scripture for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> conference and expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the places therof, or inference of that which is to be inferred out of them, ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mans help it can not ſufficiently decide queſtions of faith, I aske of Proteſtants, what men theſe muſt be; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we or they, or ſome third, who nether are Catholiks nor Proteſtants? Sure I am, they will nether admit ours nor other mens expoſitions of Scripture for their iudge, and I think they wilbe ashamed to exact of vs that we should admit their interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, eſpecially ſith they refuſe the conference, inference, and expoſition of the holy Councells, and Fathers. Wherfore vnles they will ſtand to <note place="margin">Proteſtants muſt be tried by the natiue, and vſual ſenſe of he words, or thy no ſenſe.</note> that ſenſe of Scripture which is no way partial, to wit, which the Scripture it ſelf, by it ſelf, without any conference or expoſition of man, giueth, they can name no ſenſe of Scripture which both parties may admit for their iudge: and to refuſe all ſenſe of Scripture whervpon both parties may reaſonably agree, is plainly to refuſe all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable triall by ſcripture. For ſeing the ſoule and kernel of the Scripture is the ſenſe therof; and that the letter or words is but the shell or bark of it, as is euident and both holie Fathers and Proteſtants agree, manifeſt it is, that whoſoeuer will not reaſonably agree vpon any ſenſe of
<pb facs="tcp:173883:7"/> the Church, Councells, or Fathers) where it is ſpoken of ſet purpoſe to declare Gods meaning, of it ſelf without any mans expoſition, and according to the vſual vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of men, it doth afford, rather then the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie ſenſe, which by the wreſting of Proteſtants it is compelled to carrie. Let but this right reaſon and true prudence lift vp this Balance, wherein I weigh the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of Catholiks and Proteſtants according to holie Scripture in more then 260. points, and I nothing doubt, but it will clearly ſee and iudge the Catholik doctrin agreable to Scripture and the Proteſtant, quite oppoſite and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. And this is my purpoſe, Scope, and butte in this 1. <note place="margin">The Scope of the firſt booke And of the ſecond.</note> booke, to which I adde a ſecond, wherin I manifeſtly shewe that Proteſtants <hi>Doctrin</hi> is not onely quite oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in more then 260. points both in words and meaning to the holie Scripture, but alſo, that they are forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect many and great partes of the Scripture; to alter that parte which they admit, to weaken all force of Scripture; to ſay that much of the Scripture was not ſpoken of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge, or not according to the meaning of the ſpeaker; to teach, that moſt weightie ſentences of the Scripture were ſpoken ironically, mimetically, and hyperbolically, to change the moſt vniuerſall propoſitions of the Scripture into particulers, to limitate ſpeeches not limited by the Scripture; to alter abſolute ſpeeches into conditionall; to make cauſall propoſitions not cauſall, to expound words in ſome ſorte, which were ſpake ſimply; <note place="margin">The contents of the ſecond booke.</note> which were ſpaken of one time, to interprete them of an other, to make one ſaying, of many; to vnderſtand words that ſignifie the doing of a thing, of an endeauour to doe it; which ſignifie working a thing, of the way or meane therto; which ſignifie that a thing is, to expound that it ought to be: words which ſignifie a true thing, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them of a shew or apparent thing: to expound the words of Scripture of different, yea wholy diuerſe, &amp; contrarie matters; to deuiſe improprietes and all figures of ſpeeches; to feigne friuolous and neuer before heard
<pb facs="tcp:173883:7"/> of diſtinctions; to reiect the expoſition of the Fathers, Councells, and Church: to confeſſe, that they teach <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin</hi> damned in ould time for hereſie: to fruſtate the ends of the incarnation and paſſion of Chriſt: to take out of the world all vertue and giue free ſcope to all vice: and finally, to confeſſe, that much of the Proteſtant <hi>doctrin</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to holie Scripture. All which clearly shewe, that Proteſtant leaders doe not onely teach doctrin contrarie to the Scripture, but alſo do in very deed mock and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it.</p>
            <p>8. The manner of my proceeding is this. Firſt I deuide <note place="margin">Manner of proceeding in this booke.</note> the matters which are in controuerſie according to their order, and in euerie matter I diſtinguish manie articles which I propoſe in forme of queſtion: After, I ſet downe the expreſſe words of Scripture: Next I bring the decrees of the Councell of Trent, or the Inſtructions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme of that Councell: And where I find not their determinations, I alledge the doctrin of S. Thomas, or of D. Stapleton, or Cardinal Bellarmin. Againſt theſe, I produce the aſſertions of one or manie famous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants directly oppoſite to the doctrin of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of the Catholiks. Laſtly, I gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a ſumme of the words of the holie Scripture, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſumme of the ſayings of Proteſtants, that thereby the oppoſition betwene the doctrin of them both may the better appeare. As for the words of Scripture; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pleſsie of the Church c.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 145. Let them bring one text that is cleare and euident and we are readie to yeeld vnto them.</note> I bring not all which might be brought of euerie article, becauſe nether is that neceſſarie to my purpoſe, ſith God is as much to be beleeued in one word as in manie, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as the Councell of Arauſica ſaieth truly) <hi>will manie te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture auaile any thing with him, to whome few are not ſufficient,</hi> but I bring thoſe onely teſtimonies which to me ſeemed moſt oppoſite to the words of Proteſtants, Nether do I proue, that the words of Scripture, which I cite, be cleare, and vttered of purpoſe to declare vnto vs Gods mynd of that matter wherof they treate, or do of themſelues and according to their accuſtomed acception
<pb facs="tcp:173883:8"/> amongſt men, manifeſtly afford that ſenſe in which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants gayne ſaye them; becauſe al thefe points are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by them ſelues, and the shifts which Proteſtants vſe to delude them, do manifeſtly proue them. Nether alſo do I proue, that Proteſtants can not at leaſt (touching the moſt of theſe Articles) produce any ſuch teſtimonies of Scripture, which, in expreſſe words may ſeeme directly, and without any inference, conference, or expoſition of theirs to ſpeake for them, as in theſe 260. points the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies which I bring, do ſpeake for vs. Firſt, becauſe this being a denial, it is of it ſelf ſufficiently proued, vnles the Proteſtants can demonſtrate their contrarie affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, becauſe this is euident to euerie one who <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Tertul. l. de Reſur. c.</hi> 3. <hi>Luther de verb. Caenae, fol.</hi> 389.</note> conſidereth the teſtimonies brought by Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which in verie few and almoſt no matters at all in controuerſie betwixt vs and them are ſuch, as of them ſelues without the addition of ſome humane principle or illation, they may, ſo much as ſeeme, to be directly oppoſite vnto vs. Which if Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts would conſider, they should eaſily ſee, almoſt in all controuerſies, as much difference betwene our proofes out of Scripture and theirs, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the expreſſe word of God and humane diſcourſe. Nether may they ſaye, that they are not bound to proue <note place="margin">Why Proteſt. are bound to prooue their negatiue points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</note> thoſe points wherin they contradict vs, becauſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial needeth no proof; Both becauſe in ſome contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies they are the affirmers, and we the deniers; as when they ſay, that God will and worketh ſin, tempteth and predeſtinateth to ſin; That Chriſt was truly a ſinner feared <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, ſuffered the paines of hel, the like: In which queſtions, ſeing Catholiks proue their denial by expreſſe words of Scripture, much more ought Proteſtants by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> like expreſſe words to proue their affirmation. As alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is one thing ſimply to deny or not to beleeue the Catholik affirmation (as euerie Iew, Turk, or infidel doth) an other thing, not onely to denie it or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue it, but alſo to condemne it as an vntruth contrarie to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Tertul. de Corona. c.</hi> 2.</note> Scripture, and to auouche the denial as a truth taught by
<pb facs="tcp:173883:8"/> Scripture; For albeit a ſimple denial or not beleefe need no proofe, yet ſuch a mixt denial, as denying the oppoſite affirmation, affirmeth it ſelf to be auouched by Scripture, and the affirmation to be condemned thereby, hath as great need of proofe out of Scripture, as any other affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whatſoeuer. Moreouer, theſe denials are articles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of faith with Proteſtants, and as ſuch are put in their Confeſſions of faith, and therfore ether ought to be proued by Scripture, as other articles are; or they muſt confeſſe, that they can not proue out of Scripture the greateſt parte of their faith: which principally conſiſteth of theſe negatiue articles or denials of our faith.</p>
            <p>9. As for Catholiks, for the moſt parte, I produce the <note place="margin">Why one Cath. ſaying is alledged.</note> words of one onely of the foreſaied Authors; becauſe the agreement of Catholiks in matters of faith is wel enough knowne; I might, if I would, haue my ſelf ſet downe the Catholik doctrin in euerie article in the ſame words in which the Scripture deliuereth her doctrin of the ſame: or perhappes haue found the Catholike doctrine propoſed by ſome Catholik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Author in the verie ſame words which the Scripture vſeth: But that Proteſtants should not ſaye, that it was no maruel if the Catholik doctrin be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the Scriptures words by any Author whatſoeuer; or when it is done of purpoſe, I would not ſet it downe but in the words of ſome famous Catholik writer, &amp; thoſe ſpoaken not of purpoſe to accomodate their ſpeech to the phraſe of Scripture; but ſpoaken to declare and expreſſe the Catholik doctrin. And here by we may ſee that when the Catholik doctrin is to be ſett downe moſt plainly and diſtinctly by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who beſt know it, of it nature it requireth to be deliuered with the very ſame or the likewords which the Scripture vſeth. Whence we may alſo gather (as I shal herafter) that the Catholik doctrin is in very deed one and the ſelf ſame with the doctrin of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>10. For the like cauſe I haue alledged the words onely <note place="margin">Why manie Prot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:173883:9"/> any should attribute their words to ignorance. And ſome <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> times I haue cited diuers ſayinges of the ſame Author, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> partly leſt any should think, that ſuch words fell from him vnawares: partely alſo, becauſe ſome times they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Scripture in ſo different manners of ſpeech, as if they would that none should be ignorant therof: parte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly alſo, to the end, that the Catholik Reader may make choice amongſt manie ſayings of Proteſtants, which he iudgeth moſt oppoſite to the Scriptures words. Nether yet do I feare, that the multitude of Proteſtants ſayings oppoſed againſt the Scripture, may ſcandalize any weake Catholik; for ſeing the Scripture moſt directly contrarie to them, and armed with this sheild, he wil no more regarde the Proteſtants words then ſo many barkings of of doggs againſt heauen, ſo many cries of Ieves againſt Chriſt, ſo many blaſphemies of damned men againſt God. And if it be weariſome or irkeſom to the Catholik Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to read all the blaſphemous ſpeeches of Proteſtants (as it was to me to write them out) let him runne ouer the Summe which <hi>I</hi> make of their words, or, by the notes in the margent, chuſe which are fitteſt to his purpoſe. And thus much for the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of my proceeding in this booke.</p>
            <p>11. The profit of this work is manifould. Firſt, becauſe by it a short and eaſie way may be taken to make an end <note place="margin">The profits of this worke.</note> of all controuerſies, and that out of Scirpture alone, as Proteſtants deſire: to wit, by mere rehearſall of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> words of Scripture, of Catholiks, and of famous Proteſtants touching 260. articles of controuerſie: For if it appeare that catholikes in 260. articles agree both in word and ſenſe with the expreſſe words of Scripture and theſe ſpoken of purpoſe to declare her meaning vnto vs: and that Proteſtants in thoſe 260. articles directly contradict the ſaid words and ſenſe of the holie Scripture, no man will doubt, but that all Proteſtant doctrin (for as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Catholik) is alſo contrarie to the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. An other commoditie is, that in this booke are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thoſe places of Scripture, and they ranked accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:173883:9"/> to order of their matters, which in 260. articles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and in their proper and vſual ſenſe do approue the Catholik doctrin, and condemne the Proteſtant. A third <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> commoditie is, that hereby are at hand in euerie kind of controuerſie ſuch ſayings of famous Proteſtants, as not onely directely croſſe the Scripture; but alſo many of them are ſo blaſphemous againſt God, againſt Chriſt, againſt the Saints, the Church, Sacraments, Faith, Good works: ſo oppoſite to pietie, vertue and religion: ſo fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to vice, and all licenciouſnes: ſo repugnant to reaſon, as ſome Proteſtants will deny, and others ſcarſe beleeue, that euer any of theirs taught ſuch doctrin. Whome I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt <note place="margin">The Authors fidelitie in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> to take the paines to looke vpon the bookes and places by me alledged, and then to beleeue their owne eyes. For I not onely gathered their ſayings out of their owne bookes, but alſo, after I had my ſelf gathered them and cauſed them to be faire copied out, I diligently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred them with their books, and admitted none which he, that read their bookes, did non find to be truly cited out of them. Wherfore I ſay for my ſelf as Caluin ſaid for him ſelf againſt Gentilis: <hi>There shalbe no colour for them to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine that they are ſlandered, ſeing I requeſt that iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be made of their impietie out of their owne mere words.</hi> And they, who haue had to deale with Proteſtants ether by word or writing, know well how important a thing it is, to be able to conuince them, that they teach that which in in very deed they teach; which may clearly be done by their ſayinges here rehearſed.</p>
            <p>12. The fourth commoditie of this worke is, thar here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> shall appeare, that almoſt in all controuerſies which betwene Catholiks and Proteſtants, Catholiks do ſtick faſt to the very words of Scripture, and religiouſly keepe her letter and forme of ſpeech; and Proteſtants goe fare from the words, at leſt of Scripture and bring in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, yea quite oppoſit, forme of ſpeech. Nether ought they to think this to be a ſmall fault, both becauſe they boaſting of the pure and expreſſe word of God, ought
<pb facs="tcp:173883:10"/> alſo to keep the very letter thereof, and not to reiect it and to vſe the contrarie: as alſo becauſe the Apoſtle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>to auoide profane nouelties of words, and to keepe the</hi>

               <hi>forme of holeſome words which we haue learned of him:</hi> which commandment they do not follow, who forſake the Scriptures forme of ſpeech, and embrace the contrarie: and finally, becauſe not onely the ſenſe, but alſo the words and forme of ſpeech vſed by the Scripture, did proceed from the holie Ghoſte, and therefore it is ſacrilegious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacitie to reiect Gods words and Gods forme of ſpeaking, and to bring in mans words and fashion of ſpeaking quite contrarie. As if theſe new Ghoſpelers should teach God how to deliuer his mind, or he ment to ſpeake other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by them, then he did by his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts, wherefore their impietie is not to be borne withall who when the Scripture moſt often and moſt plainly calleth the beleefe of wicked men or reprobats, <hi>faith,</hi> and neuer denieth it to be faith, yet dare ſay, <hi>that it</hi>

               </note> manifeſtly refuted in this booke, wherein is clearly she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, that the Catholik doctrin, in more then 260. points denied by Proteſtants, is in expreſſe termes and moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly taught and deliuered, by the Scripture, and in the ſame points the Proteſtants doctrin condemned: and that theſe in very deed do relie vpon their owne inferences out of Scripture, their owne conferences of places of Scripture and oppoſe their owne expoſitions, gloſſes, tropes, and figures, againſt the expreſſe words and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of almightie God.</p>
            <p>14. The ſixt commoditie is, that though ſome obſtinatly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> will not confeſſe, that in all theſe 260. points or in moſt of them, the Scripture or word of God doth expreſly approue the Catholik doctrin and condemne the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, yet this he can not denie, but in all theſe points the holie Scripture both for word and for ſenſe fauoureth more the Catholik doctrin then the Proteſtant: which if ignorant Proteſtants would mark, they would not be ſo eaſily miſled. For as for words, in all theſe 260. points we <note place="margin">Catholiks ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage ouer Proteſtants. For words of Scripture.</note> vſe the very ſame or equiualent words with the Scripture: what she calleth faith, we call faith: what she calleth the bodie of Chriſt, we call the bodie of Chriſt. And ſo in others: whereas Proteſtants do the quite contrarie, as hath beene touched before, and shall appeare in the whole booke. And as for the forme of ſpeach, where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">For phraſe of Scripture.</note> affirmeth, we affirme; where the Scripture denieth, we deny: And contrarie wiſe the Proteſtants affirme, where the Scripture denieth; and deny, where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirmeth: as shalbe moſt euident to him that will read this booke. Beſids no parte or parcell of the Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <note place="margin">For partes of Scripture.</note> Catholiks to denie it, but they hould all that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants account for Scripture and ſome what more: whereas Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are compelled to reiect manie bookes of thoſe which Catholiks and the holie Church heretofore hath beleeued to be Gods word, and fouly alſo to mangle and corrupt theſe bookes which they admit. Moreouer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks
<pb facs="tcp:173883:11"/> refuſe no authenticall edition or tranſlation of the <note place="margin">For tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Scripture: but Proteſtants will ſland to no tranſlation. And thus much touching the words of Scripture. As for <note place="margin">For the ſenſe of Scripture.</note> the ſenſe thereof: Catholiks in all theſe 260. points do admit that ſenſe, which the expreſſe words of Scripture, and they ſpoaken of purpoſe to declare Gods mynd doe of them ſelues proporſe: which ſenſe Proteſtants reiect and force the quite contrarie. Agayne, ſcarce in any of theſe 260. articles Catholiks are driuen to any anſwere which hath any shew of a shift or euaſion, becauſe in them (as I ſaied) they embrace the natiue and proper ſenſe of the words of Scripture: but Proteſtants in euerie one of them are driuen to ſundrie and foule shifts, becauſe they refuſe the naturall and plaine ſenſe of Gods word. Beſids, Catholiks in all theſe 260. points dare ſtand to the iudgment of the expreſſe worde of God according to that ſentence which of them ſelues with out all helpe, force or preſſing of Catholiks they doe pronounce: Proteſtants dare not in theſe articles ſtand to the iudgment of Gods expreſſe worde, vnles they may wreſt, wring, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete it as they thinke beſt. Finally, Catholiks in none of all theſe queſtions reiect that ſenſe of Scripture, which is deliuered by vnanimous conſent of the holie Fathers, Councells, or Church. Proteſtants refuſe it in manie. Seing therefore Catholiks haue the aduantage ouer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, not onely for Fathers, Councells, Church, mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the like, but alſo that they haue ſuch and ſo great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages ouer them in more then 260. points of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, both for the expreſſe worde, and plaine ſenſe of the Scripture, it is plaine willfulnes and careleſnes of ſaluation to leaue Catholiks for to follow Proteſtants. I would to God, that Proteſtants would (as they pretend) follow the expreſſe word of God, and embrace that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <note place="margin">Note.</note> which the expreſſe word of God moſt fauoureth, reiect that which it moſt diſliketh; and enquire diligently whether the Catholik or Proteſtant religion can in more points of controuerſie proue her doctrin by the pure and
<pb facs="tcp:173883:12"/> expreſſe written word of God without the mixture of any word of man, and by the pure ſenſe therof, which of it ſelf it affordeth without any help or expoſition of man, when it is ſpoaken of purpoſe to declare Gods meaning vnto vs. Let that religion florish and be embraced, which in this conflict ouercomet: let that perish and be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, which is ouercomen. And what more reaſonable then to preferre Gods pure word before that which is not pure, mixt partely of Gods words, partely of mans. What more reafonable, then to preferre Gods direct ſpeech, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mans inference or collection out of his ſpeech? What more reaſonable, then to follow rather Gods expreſſe words, then mans gloſſes, tropes, and figures? And finally, what more reaſonable, then to follow that religion which in more then 260. points of controuerſie is grounded vpon the pure word, the direct word, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe word of God, and hath againſt it nothing but mans mixt word, mans inference, mans gloſſes: rather then that which in all thoſe points is condemned by the pure, direct, and expreſſe word of God, and ſupported onely by mans mixt word, mans inference, and mans gloſſes? For example: That the Euchariſt is the bodie of Chriſt, we haue for vs in foure places of Scripture the pure, direct, and expreſſe word of God, ſaying: <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> and againſt vs there is not ſo much as once any pure word of God, ſaing directly and expreſly: <hi>This is not my bodie.</hi> But onely mens inference out of a mixt word, to wit: <hi>Chriſts bodie is in heauen, and can not be in two places;</hi> which word is mixt, partely of Gods word, for the former parte, and of mens word, for the latter. And shall we thinke that in a matter of faith, which we can not know but by Gods teaching, his pure and expreſſe word is not to be preferred before mens inference out of a mixt word, which is in parte mens word? What els can we thinke vnles we will euen in Gods matters preferre men before God.</p>
            <p>15. The ſeauenth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie is that in this word are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
<pb facs="tcp:173883:12"/> all or the moſt vſuall shifts wherewith Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vſe to delude the teſtimonies of holie Scripture. Which ſurely is no leſſe profitable, then to know the deceits of enemies with whom we are to fight. And as Tertullian ſaieth: <hi>VVoe be to him, who whiles he is in this life, knoweth not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De reſur. c.</hi> 19.</note> 
               <hi>the ſecrets of Heretiks.</hi> And theſe are the eſpeciall profits and commodities which may be reaped by this work; Now let vs remoue certaine ſcruples or hinderances of the reaping of them.</p>
            <p>16. The firſt ſcruple may be about the vulgar Latin tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <note place="margin">Obiections or difficulties remoued.</note> which I follow in citing the words of Scripture. But to omit all which Catholiks produce for to proue that tranſlation to be authenticall (becauſe this is no place to treate of that matter) Proteſtants co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may ſuffice, which may be ſeene in the Proteſtants Apologie for the Rom. Church Treat. 1. Sect. 10. ſubd. 4. to which I add, that Caſoubon writeth. <hi>I acknowledg the Latin tranſlation of the bible to be holie Scripture, and I account an vnperdonable fault to ſo much as doubt thereof:</hi> That Iuel. art. 17. ſect. 4. ſaieth: <hi>It hath bene euer more generally receaued in the Church:</hi> That Beza in Luc. 1. confeſſeth: <hi>That the ancient interpreter did most religiouſly tranſlate the Scripture.</hi> And in Luc. 8. v. 54. That him ſelf had <hi>twoe ancient Greek copies which meruailouſly agreed with the vulgar Latin.</hi> And Prefat. in Teſtam. That the vulgar interpreter <hi>had a truer Greek copie then theirs now are.</hi> Whitaker alſo Cont. 1. q. 2. c. 7. graunteth, <hi>that the Latin Fathers commend it and iuſtly.</hi> Hounfrey l. 1. de Rat. interpret. affirmeth. <hi>That the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretor ſeemeth enough addicted to the proprietie of the word.</hi> Moreouer Luther and Proteſtants commonly confeſſe, that Catholiks haue the word of God that the Fathers vſed the Latin tranſlation in their diſputes for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Catholik faith and confutation of Hereſies. Beſids Fulk in his preface to the Teſtament, ſaieth, that <hi>none of them calleth the vulgar tranſlation of the new teſtament, Papiſticall, as though it were tranſlated by Papists, or els made ſo greatly for Papiſts when it is rightly vnderſtood.</hi> Finally the
<pb facs="tcp:173883:13"/> vulgar Latin tranſlation differeth not from the originall Hebrew or Greek text, but in very few of thoſe places which here I cite; and therefore it wilbe but vayne to cauil here about this matter.</p>
            <p>17. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſcruple may be, that ſome times the very <note place="margin">why Proteſt. can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them ſelues by the Scripture.</note> Scripture contradicteth it ſelf in shew of words, and neuertheles in ſenſe and meaning is neuer repugnant to it ſelf. And therefore it is not ſo great meruail if Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſome time contradict the words of Scripture, nether can it be thereof inferred that the contradict the ſenſe. To this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I anſwer, that the Scripture nether ſo often, nor in ſo many and ſo weightie matters, nor ſo manifeſtly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contradicteth it ſelf in words, as Proteſtants doe: Nether need we ſo many and ſo incredible shifts for to reconcile the words of Scripture, as Proteſtants need to reconcile their ſayings with the Scripture. Beſids, God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may ſpeak as he pleaſeth, &amp; therefore may for to exerciſe our faith and ſtudie mingle ſome shew of contradiction in his words: but Proteſtants are bound to ſpeak as God ſpeaketh, and not to gaine ſay ſo much as his words, as doubtles they would not, if their meaning were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to his. Agayne, we may not out of anie ſeeming <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> contradiction in Gods words, infer anie oppoſition in his meaning, becauſe we know, that he can not be contrarie to him ſelf: but we know that Proteſtants can not be contrarie to Gods meaning, as we ſee that they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his words: and therefore out of their ſo frequent, ſo manifeſt, ſo direct contradicting of his words, we iuſtly inferre, that they alſo contradict his meaning, as we would inferre the ſame of anie Heretiks whatſoeuer. Moreouer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this cauil will no more help Proteſtants, then it will help anie other Heretiks, ſith there were euer ſcarce anie, who ſo often, ſo plainly, ſo directly contradicted the expres word of God, as Proteſtants haue done. And therefore ether we may inferre out of the Proteſtants contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the words of God, that they alſo contradict his true meaning, or we can not inferre that of anie Heretiks
<pb facs="tcp:173883:13"/> whatſoeuer. But of this more in the ſecond booke cap. 1.</p>
            <p>18. The third ſcruple may be, that perhaps alſo <note place="margin">VVhy they can not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them ſelues by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks.</note> ſome Catholik writers haue in shew of words contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the Scripture. But to this I anſwere that this is to accuſe others, not to cleare them ſelues: Let them firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for them ſelues, before they recriminate others. And if anie of them will goe about to lay the like fault vpon Catholiks, let him keep theſe moſt iuſt and equal conditions. Firſt, let him not medle with other matters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> then ſuch as are in controuerſie betwixt vs and them, as I touch no other matters. Secondly, let him bring forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in ſo manie controuerſies, ſo manifeſt and ſo direct teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of holie Scripture agreeing with their doctrin both in wordes and ſenſe, and oppoſite to our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, as I haue brought. <hi>Thou muſt proue</hi> (ſaieth Tertullian) <hi>as euidently as we proue. Giue me a proof which I demand like to</hi>

We demande ſome manifeſt place which needeth no interpreter.</hi> Thirdly, let him shew that the Councell of Trent contradicteth as directly ſo many and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſo expres places of Scripture, and that in ſo weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as we haue shewed that theire confeſſions of faith, <hi>of which</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>they make almoſt as great account of, as</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Vorſtius prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. Antil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praefat. Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagm.</note> 
               <hi>we doe of the Councell of Trent.</hi> Fourthly, let him shew, that ſo many and ſo famous Catholik writers haue in ſo many and ſo great controuerſies contradicted the expres propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions or aſſertions of the holie Scripture, as we haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> shewed of the Proteſtant writers. I ſay <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> or <hi>Aſsertions,</hi> becauſe it is a farre greater matter to contradict the proportions of Scripture, in which it pronounceth a thing to be, or not to be; to be ſuch, or not to be ſuch, then to varie onely from ſome of the words wherewith here or there it ſignifieth this or that thing. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is a farre greater matter to deny the Euchariſt to be the bodie of Chriſt, which the Scripture often times &amp; plainly affirmeth, then not to call it bread as ſome times
<pb facs="tcp:173883:14"/> the Scripture doth, but neuer directly ſaieth that it is bread: Wherevpon Spalatenſis l. 5. de repub. c. 6. writeth thus: <hi>It is one thing, for a ſeeming thing to be called by the name of the true thing, which the appearence doth shew; An other, to be ſaid, This is that. The firſt may and is borne withall in all equiuocall termes, but not the latter.</hi> Wherefore let him omit theſe kinds of matters. Fiftly, let him shew, that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> haue done thus, not by the way, treating of other matters, but of ſet purpoſe, as Proteſtants haue done, who moſt often then contradict the Scripture in plaine termes, euen then when they anſwere it or comment vpon it. Laſtly, let him shew, that Catholiks haue beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> forced for the maintenance of their doctrin to denie ſo many bookes, to corrupt ſo many places of holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to deuiſe, ſo many and ſo incredible shifts, as we haue shewed the Proteſtants haue done, or let him be ashamed to ſay, that Catholiks are as faultie in this kind, as Proteſtants be. Moreouer, though they could proue, that ſome Catholiks haue bene as faultie herein, as they are (which they can neuer proue) yet that would nothing preiudice the Chatholik Church, becauſe her faith is not the doctrin of one or of many Catholiks, but the common of them all: But the Proteſtant faith is in many points the doctrin of ſome or of manie of them, euerie one of them making that a point of faith, which him ſelf gathereth out of Scripture, whether his fellows beleeue it, or no. Beſids, the Catholik Church, if she find anie thing in the writinges of her children contrarie to holie Scripture, she nether alloweth nor diſſembleth it, but commandeth it to be blotted out, as is euident by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorie Indices; but the Proteſtant ether approueth or diſſembleth the errors of her writers, and ſo maketh them her owne. <note place="margin">VVhy all Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s here related may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to the Prot. Church.</note>
            </p>
            <p>19. The fourth ſcruple may be, that all the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictions againſt holie Scripture, which are here rehearſed out of Proteſtant writers, were not made nor allowed of all Proteſtants, or of their Church, and therefore all of them
<pb facs="tcp:173883:14"/> are not to be imputed to all Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or to their Church. I anſwere. Firſt, that very many of the Contradictions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> againſt holie Scripture here ſet downe are found in their Confeſſions of faith, and in other writings ſet forth in their common name: which Contradictions are moſt iuſtly attributed to their Church, and theſe alone ſuffice to shew, that the very faith and common doctrin of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants is directly oppoſite both to the word and ſenſe of holie Scripture. Secondly, almoſt all theſe Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are taken out of the writings of the firſt, the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and famouſeſt teachers, guides, and leaders of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and therefore ether Proteſtants muſt acknowledge theſe Contradictions, or reiect the doctrin of their firſt and chefeſt Maiſters as directly contrarie to Gods word. Thirdly, all the Contradictions or Antitheſes here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> are taken out of famous writers and mainteiners of the Proteſtant faith, whoſe doctrin the Proteſtant Church hath not publikly condemned, nor compelled the Authors thereof to recall it, nor commanded it to be taken out of their writings, and therefore, if not by publike conſent, yet by ſilence and diſſembling approueth it, and ſo (as I ſaied before) maketh it her owne. Fourthly, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> obiect to the Catholik Church whatſoeuer any Cotholik writer, though neuer ſo obſcure, hath written: why then may not we better obiect vnto their Church what many and the moſt famous of their writers haue published? Finally my intention in this workes not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> shew the Contradictions of this or that Proteſtant man or Church againſt the holie Scripture; but of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in generall, eſpecially of the cheefeſt and moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</p>
            <p>But whether the Contradictions of Scripture made by <note place="margin">And though they could not yet that would ſuffice.</note> many and famous Proteſtant writers, and not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but diſſembled by their Church, be to be obiected to their Church, or no, theſe points enſuing will ſuffice to my purpoſe. Firſt, that the commun fairh of Proteſtants is in many and weightie articles directly contrarie to the
<pb facs="tcp:173883:15"/> expreſſe word and cleare meaning of holie Scripture, as is euident by that which in diuers articles I recite out of their Confeſſions of faith and other their common wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. The ſecond is, that touching many other matters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that ſelf ſame doctrin which I cite out of other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, is conteined in their Confeſſions of faith though it be not deliuered there in termes ſo expreſly oppoſite to the words of holie Scripture, as it is by other Proteſtants. The third is, that much of that Proteſtant Doctrin which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> here if cite as oppoſite to holie Scripture, is in very deed the common beleef of Proteſtants, albeit it be not inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Confeſſions. The fourth point is, that thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Proteſtants whoſe words I alledge, knew the common <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apol. Anglic Cont.</hi> 2. <hi>q.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>de Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. c.</hi> 42.</note> doctrin of Proteſtants, as well as anie who now will denie or reiect that doctrin. The fift is, that Iuel, Whitaker, Feild, and diuers other Proteſtants auouch, that there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall difference in doctrin amongſt the cheefe Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which ether they muſt confeſſe to befalſe, or maintaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the doctrin which here I cite out of their cheefeſt writers. The ſixt point is, that houſoeuer the doctrin which I cite, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> is not in all points the Doctrin of this Proteſtant man or Church, yet it is as I ſaied Proteſtant doctrin, taught and maintained by famous Proteſtants, ſuch as our English Proteſtants hould communion withall, and account them their brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Chriſt, And therefore ether let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defend their doctrin, or refuſe their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion. The ſeuenth point is, that whether all or moſt of the Proteſtant doctrin, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> here I cite as oppoſite to holie Scripture, be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin or beleefe of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, or no, this alone would ſuffice to my purpoſe, that the doctrin of the firſt, chefeſt, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſeſt Proteſtant preachers and leaders, is in more then <note place="margin">Note.</note> 260. points of controuerſie quite oppoſite to the expreſſe words of holie Scripture. For thereby euerie one may ſee, that the firſt &amp; cheefeſt Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t preachers, did not teach the word of God, but the word of the Diuel quite contrarie there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o: were not miniſters of the word of God, but mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Diuel: not Reformers, but Deformers: not
<pb facs="tcp:173883:15"/> ſent of God, but thruſt on by the Diuel: not lightned from heaune, but blinded from hel: not Apoſtles, but Apoſtatas: not Paſtores but wolues: who vnder a moſt falſe pretence of the word of God, did moſt directly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne it, drew Criſtians from Gods truth to the Diuels lies, from the lap of the Catholik Church to the den of theues, from the aſſured path of ſaluation to the open way of damnation.</p>
            <p>Finally I aduertiſe the Reader, that if at anie time I vſe anie sharp words againſt Proteſtants, I intend them onely againſt their teachers and leaders, yet vſe I the common name of Proteſtants, that the reſt may know that the crimes which I obiect vnto them, proceed of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and thereby flie and reiect it, leſt they become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the crimes. I shew them the gulfe of impietie, into which their guides doe lead them: let them not be offended with me, that I ſet before their eyes the impietie of the doctrin which they are tought, but let them be angrie with their teachers who vnder the moſt falſe pretenſe of Scripture and Gods word, haue thaught them ſuch impious doctrin and ſo contrarie to Gods words. And I hartely pray God, and euer shal, that he open their eyes, that they may ſee the moſt imminent and greiuous danger wherein they ſtand, and auoide it, &amp; lighten with his true light that zeale which they haue to his word, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</note> leſt they perish for euer with them who had zeale but not according to knowledge.</p>

And becauſe Proteſtants auouch them ſelues to be the true owners of the Scripture, I need not proue to them that ether Catholiks or they are the true owners thereof (which the very queſtion doth ſuppoſe) but it will ſuffice againſt them that I shew, that according to all reaſon, Catholiks are to be iudged the true owners of Scripture rather then they.</p>
               <p>The firſt proofe hereof I will take from the actuall <note place="margin">The firſt title for Cathol. actual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> poſſeſſion of the Scripture, in which Catholiks peacably were, when Luther and the Proteſtants firſt began to chalenge the Scripture for theirs. For reaſon teacheth vs to iudge the Poſſeſſor of anie thing to be the true owner of the ſame, and poſſeſſion to be a ſufficient title of houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, vnles the contrarie be manifeſtly proued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced, as we ſee dayly in lands and temporall goods: and otherewiſe the dominion of things would be vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine amongſt men. Wherevpon the law teacheth the Poſſeſſor to plead poſſeſſion as a ſufficient title, and to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173883:17"/> ſay <hi>poſsideo quia poſsideo: I poſſeſſe becauſe I poſſeſſe.</hi> But Proteſtants can not manifeſtly diſproue, no nor yet colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably impugne the right of the Catholiks poſſeſſion of the holie Scripture, as shall hereafter appeare. Therefore according to all reaſon Catholiks vpon this title of their poſſeſſion are to be iudged true owners of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>The ſecond proof I will take from the Catholiks vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted <note place="margin">Second title, peacable poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion.</note> poſſeſſion thereof, and vnqueſtioned by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants for manie ages. That Proteſtants did not for manie ages call the Catholiks poſſeſſions of the Scripture into queſtion, is manifeſt, by the manie and plaine confeſſions of Proteſtants, that their Church was inuiſible before Luther for manie ages, which I haue related in my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of the Author of the Proteſtant Church c. 4. And reaſon teacheth vs to accounte him the true owner of a thing, who without all queſtion or clame of anie, hath hould it peacably for manie ages together. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the law alloweth preſcription of certaine yeares, after which time expired, it permitteth not the poſſeſſion to be called in queſtion. Beſides, it is no way likelie, that the true Church of God would ſuffer her ſelf to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaued of ſo heauenlie a treaſure, as is the holie Scripture, and yet not once in anie corner of the world, for manie ages crie after the theefe, or chalenge her treaſure, which she did ſee was held of others. Will men euerie day ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture their liues for ſauing or recouering a little land or goods, and would not the Church of God (the onely true owner of the Scripture) for manie ages once open her mouth to chalenge ſo heauenlie a treaſure; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Scripture being (as Proteſtants teach) the onely <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Martyr in diſput. oxon. p.</hi> 143. <hi>Pareus Coll.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173883:17"/> means to obtayne them? Would the primitiue Church ſuffer ſo manie torments and cruell death (as we read in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorie) rather then looſe the holie Scriptures, which the Heathens would haue taken from her, and would she afterward ſuffer Papiſts to take it from her without muttering one word, or laying clame to it for manie ages together. Moreouer how had she faith, how obtained she ſaluation, if for maine ages she loſt the onely externall, infallible, and neceſſarie meanes to obtayne them?</p>
               <p>The third proof, is that the Catholiks poſſeſſion of the Scripture is farre more ancient then the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">Third title, ancienteſt poſſeſsion.</note> thereof. For euident it is, that that Chriſtian Church which is the firſt and ancienteſt poſſeſſor of the holie Scripture, is the onely true owner of the ſame: becauſe the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts left their writings firſt and <note place="margin">Qui prior eſt tempore, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior eſt iure. Reg. iuris.</note> onely to the true Church, and gaue her the teſtament and laſt will of Chriſt her ſponſe, ſo that the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian Church had the Scripture, before anie falſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church had it, and likewiſe certaine it is, that she neuer loſt it ſince it was deliuered vnto her, but as she is the pillar of truth, ſo she hath faithfully kept this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly truth deliuered vnto her in writing: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is ancienter poſſeſſor of the Scripture then anie falſe Chriſtian Church can be. And this reaſon the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians vſed againſt Heretiks, as appeareth by theſe words of Tertullian lib. de Praeſcript. c. 37. <hi>It is my poſſeſsion. I poſſeſſe it of ould. I poſſeſſe it firſt. I am the herie of the Apoſtles.</hi> And lib. 4. cont. Mart. c. 4. <hi>I ſay my Bible is true: Marcion ſaieth, His. I ſay Marcions</hi> (Bible) <hi>is corrupted. Marcion ſaieth, Mine is corrupted what shall end our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, but order of time, giuing authoritie to that which is found to be ancienter, and reiecting that which is later. For in that falſitie is a corruption of trueth, trueth muſt needs be before falſitie.</hi> Thus by their greater antiquitie of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Bible, and alſo by the greater antiquitie of the Bible it ſelf did the ancient Chriſtians proue againſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173883:18"/> Heretiks both that their Bibles were the true Bibles, and alſo that they were the true owners of them. But mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it is, that Catholiks are ancienter poſſeſſors of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture then Proteſtants be, in ſo much as we shall ſee Proteſtants confeſſe, that they had the Scripture of Catholiks. Therefore Catholiks are the true owners of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>The fourth proof is taken from that there can be no <note place="margin">4. <hi>title no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of poſſeſsion named.</hi>
                  </note> place or time named, where or when Catholiks firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take poſſeſſion of the holie Scripture, beſides the very time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who alone could giue true and lawfull poſſeſſion of the Scripture. Whereas <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Author of the Prot. religion l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> we can name the place and time when Proteſtants firſt began to Vſurpe poſſeſſion of the holie Scripture. Which is long after the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. And all reaſon bindeth, vs to accounte them the true owners of a thing, the beginning of whoſe poſſeſſion can not be found, but at the very time of the firſt giuers thereof, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then thoſe whoſe poſſeſſion began manie hundreds of years after.</p>
               <p>The fift proof I will ground vpon that the Catholiks <note place="margin">5. <hi>title the integritie of Scripture.</hi>
                  </note> haue conſerued the holie Scripture incorrupt. For theeues and wrong poſſeſſors vſe to disfigure the thing they haue ſtolne as much as they can, that it may not be knowne. Beſides, the Scripture muſt needs be contrarie to the vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and agreable to the true owners, therefore neceſſitie forceth vſurpers to alter the Scripture, as falſe heires are forced to alter the will or teſtament if they get it into their hands. Wherevpon we ſee, that ſcarce euer there were anie Heretiks, who haue not ſaught to corrupt the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertul. de preſcript. c.</hi> 17 38.</note> Scripture, albeit Catholiks cried out againſt their ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious impietie. How much more then would Papiſts haue corrupted the Scripture (eſpecially whiles for manie ages there were no viſible Proteſtants to reproue them) if they had not beene the true owners of the Scripture? But Catholiks haue not in all theſe ages, in which Proteſtants were inuiſible, corrupted anie parte of the Scripture, as is
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173883:18"/> euident by that Proteſtants confeſſe, that Scripture which they had of Catholiks, to be pure and incorrupt. Nether do Proteſtants obiect to Catholiks anie corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by them in the Hebrew or Greek text, and the vulgar Latin they will haue to be ancienter then Papiſtrie it ſelf. But contrariewiſe, Catholiks haue euer ſince the beginning of Proteſtancie charged Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts with manie and greiuous corruptions of holie Scripture. Wherefore thus I argue. All reaſon teacheth vs to iudge them to be the true owners of a teſtament, who are the freeſt from corrupting it. But Catholiks are farre more free from corruptinge the teſtament of Chriſt then Proteſtants: Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſixt proof I will take from the Proteſtants graunt, <note place="margin">Sixt title: graunt of Proteſtants.</note> that they had the Scripture from Catholiks. Luther in 16. Ioan. to. 4. Germ. witenb. fol. 227. <hi>There is an argument which can very hardly be wreſted from the Papiſts, and which I my ſelf can very hardly anſwere and refute, eſpecially ſith we are forced to giue and graunt them ſo manie thinges, which are true, to wit, that in Poperie, is the word, the Apoſtleshippe, and that we receaued the holie Scripture, baptiſme, the Sacraments and office of preaching from them, otherwiſe what should we haue knowne of all theſe things?</hi> And to. 5. in 1. Gal. fol. 293. <hi>we had indeed the Scripture and the Sacraments of the Papiſts.</hi> Schuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelburg to. 8. Catal. Haereſ. p. 439. <hi>VVe denie not, that Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaieth, that in Poperie is all Chriſtian good, and from thence came to vs.</hi> D. Daue of Recuſancie. p. 13. <hi>VVe hould the Creed of the Apoſtles, of Athanaſius, of Nice, of Epheſus, of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, which the Papiſts alſo do hould, and the ſame Bible which we receaued from them.</hi> Whitaker Cont. 2. q. 5. c. 14. <hi>Papiſts haue the Scripture, Baptiſme, Catechiſme, the articles of faith, the ten commandements, the lords praier, and theſe things come from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs.</hi> Iames Andreas li. cont. Haſ. p. 316. <hi>VVe denie not, that we receaued the Scriptures from you.</hi> The like hath Spalatenſis lib. cont. Suar. c. 1. n. 34. and others. <note place="margin">A queſtion propoſed to Proteſtants.</note> Wherefore I aske the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, how they had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of vs? Did we giue it them? Did we ſell it them? Did
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173883:19"/> we change it with? Did we relinquish it as a forlorne thing. No one of all theſe can they proue or affirme with anie apparence. How then get they the Scripture from vs, but as theeues get the true mens goods, and as Turkes and Iews get the ſame Scripture from vs? If anie ſay as Andrews and Schuſſelb. do intimate, that Proteſtants had the Scripture of Catholiks, as Chriſtians had the ould teſtament of the Iewes, I anſwere, that Chriſtians had not the ould teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Iewes, if by Iewes they meane ſuch as remained Iewes. For Chriſtians had the ould teſtament of the Apoſtles, and they of Chriſt who was lord of the ould and new teſtament, as they had from him the Sacraments, and all other goods of the Church. Beſides, euerie Heretik may pretend this as well as Proteſtants. Wherefore thus I argue: They whome their aduerſaries confeſſe to haue had the Scripture before them ſelues, and can tell no lawfull means by which they had the Scripture from them, are according to all reaſon to be held the true owners of the Scripture, rather then their aduerſaries; But ſuch are Catholiks in reſpect of Proteſtants. Therefore &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth proof I will take from the open and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifould <note place="margin">Seuenth title: other confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant.</note> confeſſions of Proteſtants. For firſt they confeſſe, that Catholiks are the true Church of Chriſt, as I haue shewed at longe in my foreſaied booke of the Author of the Proteſtant religion lib. 1. c. 2. to which I add theſe few. Spalatenſis lib. 5. de repub. c. 6. n. 236. <hi>The Rom. Church is not gone ſo farre from the foundation, as that she is to be put wholy out of the membres of the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> lib. cont. Suarem. c. 1. n. 20. <hi>I think (as I haue often ſaied) that the Rom. Church with thoſe that follow here, are the true Church of Chriſt.</hi> D. Featlie in his Refutation of Fisher p. 82. <hi>The Rom. Church we acknowledge to be a member, though a ſicke and weake one, of the Catholik viſible Church.</hi> The like hath D. Hall in his booke of ould religion: and his twoe defenders Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meley and Batterfeild, whereof the latter in his preface ſaieth he <hi>will demonſtrate that the Rom. Church is a true</hi>

                  <hi>Church.</hi> Now certaine it is, that the true Church is the true ower of the Scripture. Secondly, they confeſſe, that Catholik Paſtors are true paſtors, as is shewed in the ſaied booke c. 2. cit. and Caluin in Ezechiel. c. 3. v. 9. ſaieth, that <hi>Papiſts chalenge the name of the Church, becauſe they pretend a continuall ſucceſsion. And indeed</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>we are forced to confeſſe, that they haue the ordinarie miniſterie.</hi> And who can denie, but the true Paſtors of Gods Church are true owners of Gods worde, which they haue authoritie to preach? Thereby, they confeſſe, that Catholiks are true poſſeſſors of the holie Scripture. For thus writeth Luther to. 2. Germ. fol. 279. cited by Scarpius in Eccleſ. c. 6. <hi>VVe confeſſe, that vnder Poperie are manie Chriſtian goods, yea all Christian good, and that it came from thence to vs. Namely we confeſſe, that in Poperie, is true holie Scripture, true baptiſme, true office of preaching, true Sacrament of the altar, true keyes to forgiue ſinnes, true Catechiſme. Nay I ſay that in Poperie is true</hi>

For albeit they be not ſufficient iudges in the queſtion of the trueth of doctrin, yet are they ſufficient in queſtion of facte as this is. And in this <note place="margin">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173883:20"/> And as Chriſtians can iudge, what kind of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans are the true owners of the Alcoran, though they think not the Alcoran to conteyne true doctrin: So may Infidels iudge, what kinde of Chriſtians be true owners of the Ghoſpel though they beleeue not the Ghoſpel to be the worde of God.</p>
               <p>The ninth proof may be taken from the agreement of <note place="margin">9. <hi>title: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </note> the Cath. doctrin both in words and ſenſe with the holie Scripture, as shall appeare in this booke. Which proofe though taken alone doe not conuince that Catholiks are true owners of the Scripture: yet in conuinceth that they are true owners rather then Proteſtants, who ſo farre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree from the Scripture both in words and ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The tenth proofe shalbe, that Proteſtants againſt theſe <note place="margin">10. <hi>title weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Proofes.</hi>
                  </note> ſo manie and ſo forcible proofes for the Catholiks, can bring no other proofe for their right to Scripture, then that they haue the true doctrin of Scripture. Which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken alone, is (as I shewed at large in my ſaied booke <hi>De Authore, &amp;c.</hi> lib. 2. c. 15.) a fond Sophiſme or Foularie. Firſt becauſe Schiſmatiks haue the true doctrin of Scripture, as I there proued by reaſon, by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of holie Fathers, and the confeſſion of Proteſtants, and yet are no true owners of the Scripture, becauſe they are no true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church, as I there alſo proued. Secondly, for Proteſtants to proue that they be true ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Scripture, becauſe they haue the true doctrin thereof, is to proue one vnknowne and falſe thing by an other as vnkowne and falſe. Which is not to proue at all, becauſe all proofe muſt be from a thing more knowne. Thirdly they nether proue that they haue the doctrin of the Scripture by expreſſe words of Scripture, for theſe are quite againſt them as shalbe shewed in this booke: nor by plaine inference out of the words of Scripture, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the Catholiks anſwers vnto all their proofes, nor finally they haue proued any thing before a lawfull iudge: but all their proofes are ſuch as euerie Heretike maketh. Beſides, if truth of doctrin doe proue true right to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173883:20"/> it farre more maketh for Catholiks: and no more for Proteſtants, then for anie other Heretiks.</p>
               <p>Out of all which hath beene ſaied in this Chapter, it is moſt euident, that if the light of reaſon may be iudge in this matter, Catholiks muſt needs be counted the true owners of the holie Scripture, becauſe they haue all the foreſaied Titles, then the which both fewer and weaker would make a claime to worldlie matters out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: of all which Proteſtants can pretend none but the laſt. Secondly it is euident, that if Catholiks be the true <note place="margin">If Cath. be true owners of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies are ended.</note> owners of the Scripture, the ſacred teſtament of Chriſt, they are alſo true owners of the holie Sacraments, of the keyes of heauen to binde and looſe ſinnes, of the means of ſaluation, and of all the goods which Chriſt hath by his will and teſtament bequeathed to his Church. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly all theſe things pertaine to them, to whome Chriſts teſtament doth belong. Thirdly it is euident, that if Catholiks be true owners of the Scriptures, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants be vniuſt vſurpers of them, as Iewes, Turkes, and Infidels are, and haue no more right to keep or vſe them againſt Catholiks, then theeues haue to vſe true mens goods or weapons againſt them. For cleare it is, that Catholiks and Proteſtants are oppoſite Churches, as I haue shewed in the foreſaied booke. <hi>De Authore lib.</hi> 1. c. 2. and lib. 2. c. 6. and that one of them is a falſe Church, whereas the Scriptures were giuen and belong to one onely Church. Wherefore we may well ſay to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as Tertullian de Preſcript. c. 37. ſaied to Heretiks of his time: <hi>VVho are you, when and whence came you, what doe you in mine, being not mine? By what right Marcion</hi> (Luther) <hi>doeſt thou fell my woods? By what licence Valentin</hi> (Caluin) <hi>doest thou turne away my water? By what authoritie Apelles</hi> (Zuingle) <hi>doeſt thou charge my bounds? It is my poſſeſsion, what doe you ſtrangers here ſow and feed at your pleaſure?</hi> And the ſame ſay we to Proteſtants. Let them firſt shew, what right they haue to Scriptures, before they argue out of them; let them render vs our weapons, or shew what iuſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173883:21"/> title they haue to them before they fight with them againſt vs. For as the ſame Tertull. ſaieth. c. 15. <hi>Here we first ſtop them, that they are not to be admitted to anie dispute of Scriptures. VVe muſt ſee whether they may haue them or no, to whom belongeth the Scripture, that he be not admitted to it, to whom it appertaineth not.</hi> And c. 19. <hi>The order of the matter did require, that to be firſt propoſed, which alone is now to be diſputed? Fourthly whoſe is the faith, whoſe is the Scripture?</hi> Fourthly it is euident, that if anie Proteſtant will (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that hath beene ſaied) iudge, that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are the true owners of Scripture, rather then Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks, he will giue that iudgment in a matter of ſuch great moment, which he would be ashamed to giue in a queſtion of the leaſt trifle in the world. For who ſeing that one hath nine titles to a peece of ground, of all which titles his aduerſarie hath no pretence, and that he hath as good (if not farre better) shew alſo of the tenth title, as his aduerſarie hath, would not be ashamed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudge the land to his aduerſarie, and caſt him out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, who was actuall poſſeſſor when the matter came firſt in queſtion, was peacable poſſeſſor for manie ages, was the ancienter poſſeſſor, and of whoſe poſſeſſion no <note place="margin">Note this.</note> beginning can be found but from the true lord, and from whom his aduerſarie hath whatſoeuer he hath, whoſe lawfull poſſeſſion thereof all kinde of aduerſaries do ſome time confeſſe, and put his aduerſarie in poſſeſſion who can pretend no title but that which alone ſufficeth not, and which alſo for better agreeth to the ancient poſſeſſor? If anie ſay, that in wordly matters reaſon would giue iudgment for the ancient poſſeſſor, but not in heauenlie or deuine matters, as the Scripture is, I demand, what Scripture, what worde of God teacheth vs to checke the light of reaſon concerning the true poſſeſſion of the Scripture? If none, why then doe we not follow reaſon in this matter of fact concerning the true poſſeſſion of Scripture, as well as in others? Beſides, this were to grante that the light of reaſon is in this matter with Catholiks
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173883:21"/> againſt Proteſtants: and conſequently that to be a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, one muſt firſt caſt away reaſon, euen in a matter which is vnder the reach of reaſon, as is, who are the true owners of the Scriptures. Moreouer, the very end of this Balance is no other, then to shew, that if we will follow the light of reaſon and true prudence, we ought to imbrace the Catholik religion and reiect the Proteſtant, and that to doe otherwiſe, is to caſt away reaſon and prudence, and to become vnreaſonable and imprudent men, and to ſay, that Chriſt hath giuen vs a Religion, which is not onely aboue reaſon, but euen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to reaſon, and that alſo in matters ſubiect to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and that we can not become faithfull men, but we muſt firſt become vnreaſonable men, not receaue his light of faith, before we put out his light of reaſon, wherewith he hath made vs like to him ſelfe and ſuperiours to beaſts. Thus we ſee, how farre, in all reaſon and prudence, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks are aboue Proteſtants, for the right claime, or iuſt poſſeſſion of holie Scripture: Now let vs ſee in the reſt of this booke how farre alſo they are aboue them for the letter or wordes of Scripture: and in the ſecond booke how farre they are aboue them for the true ſenſe thereof.</p>

                     <head>THE CONFERENCE OF THE FORESAIED WORDS OF THE HOLIE SCRIPTVRE, OF CATHOLIKS, AND OF PROTESTANTS.</head>
                     <p>The Scripture expreſſely ſaieth, that God will not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie or ſinne; nay that he cannot looke toward it. The ſame ſaye Catholiks.</p>
                     <p>Proteſtants expreſſely ſay, that God would haue Adam to ſinne, would haue his fall, his reuolt; that God willeth ſinne, willeth wickednes for ſome other end, will haue iniquitie to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted though he delighte not in it, as a ſick man will drinke a bitter potio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though he take no delighte in it, that the cauſes of damnation came with Gods will, that he willeth ſinne with a hidden and good pleaſing will. Which are as directly againſt the foreſaied words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as any can be. Nether will it auaile Ptoteſtants, to ſaye (as ſome times they doe) that God willeth ſinne, as it is the occaſion of ſome good, to wit, of manifeſting
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:173883:40"/> his iuſtice in punishing it, or his mercie in pardoning it. Becauſe, in ſaying that God willeth ſinne, wickedneſſe, iniquitie, mans fall, mans reuolt, the cauſes of damnations (as in plaine termes they doeſaye) they not onely affirme: that God willeth the act in which iniquitie is, but the very iniquitie, malice, or ſinfulnes it ſelf, as is manifeſt both by the foreſaied words, as alſo becauſe they ſome times teach (as we shall ſee hereafter article 5.) that ſinne, as it is ſinne, is preordinated of God. And in ſaying, that God willeth iniquitie or ſinfulnes it ſelfe, they directly contradict the aforecited words of holie Scripture. For therein they meane, that iniquitie or ſinne is one of thoſe things which are willed of God, which the Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly denieth. Nether is this contradiction auoided by adding, that though iniquitie be willed of God, yet it is not willed of him for it ſelfe, or as it is iniquitie, but as it is an occaſion of ſome good, becauſe ſtill it is affirmed that iniquitie it ſelfe is one of the things which are willed of God; as in their owne example; True it is, that a bitter potion is willed of the ſicke, though it be not willed of him for it ſelfe, nor as it is bitter, but as it is a meane to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer health. Wherefore in this matter, we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish twoe queſtions. The one is ſimple or abſolute: to wit, <hi>Whether God will iniquitie or ſinne it ſelfe:</hi> To which queſtion the holie Scripture anſwereth negatiuely, and the Proteſtants affirmatiuely. The other is a redoubling queſtion, namely, <hi>Whether God will iniquitie or ſinne, as it is iniquitie or ſinne, and for it ſelfe:</hi> To which queſtion both the Scripture and Proteſtants anſwere negatiuely, but this their agreement with the Scripture in this ſecond que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſaueth not their diſagreement from it in the former queſtion: which diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that which here I vrge. Moreouer, nether man nor the diuell him ſelfe can will iniquitie, as iniquitie, or for it ſelfe, becauſe as ſuch, it is a pure priuation of good, and nothing can be willed of any, but as it is good, ether true or apparent good.

                        <hi>to ill.</hi> Finally, to ſay that God willeth ſinne as it is a meane to ſome good end, is to make him like to them, who as the Apoſtle writeth, Roman. 3. ſay: <hi>Let vs doe euill that good may follow: whoſe damnation</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>is iuſt.</hi> Blaſphemous therefore it is, and againſt holie Scripture, that God will iniquitie or ſinne, vnder what conſideration ſoeuer he be ſaied to will it.

For as touching iniquitie or ſinne; the God of the holie Scripture and of Catholiks, willeth it not, worketh it not, doth not predeſtinate nor tempt men vnto it, doth not command neceſſitate or compell to ſinne: But the God of Proteſtants doth all theſe, as appeareth out of the. 1. 4. 5. 6. 7. and 8. Article. As concerning ſinners; the God of Scripture and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks hateth all that worke iniquitie, is angrie with the faithfull when they ſinne, and punisheth them for ſinnes committed: The Proteſtants God doth none of theſe, as appeareth by the 9. 11. and 12. Article. As for good workes; the God of Scripture and of Catholiks, is delighted with them, is worshipped with them, accepteth good works not commanded, is appeaſed with good works, will haue his commandments kept: The Proteſtants God doth all the contrarie, as is ſeene by the 13. 14. 15. 16. and 17.

As touching men or mankind; the Scripture and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks God, loueth all, would haue all ſaued, would (as a hen her chickins) gather euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which will not come, will not the death of a ſinner, nor damneth men but for ſinne: The Proteſtants God is quite contrarie; as is euident by the 18. 19. 20. 21. 22.

And finally concerning power: the Scriptures and Catholiks God is omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, can do thoſe things which shall neuer be, can make a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell paſſe through a needls eye: Such is not the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants God, as is to be ſeene by the 23. and 24.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173883:63"/> God propoſed vnto vs by the holie Scripture and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks, hath, it is euident, that it is an other and a new God different from the God which the Scripture teacheth: yea that it is (as Caluin ſpeaketh of the Libertins God) <hi>an idol,</hi>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173883:63"/> haue his commandments kept, commandeth that which he will not haue done, and promiſeth that which he will not performe. They robbe him of his omnipotencie, <note place="margin">Omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie.</note> whiles they affirme, that there are manie things which he cannot doe. And in place of theſe admirable vertues, they giue to him the contrarie vices. For in ſteed of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they attribute vnto him malice, wherewith he willeth, worketh, decreeth iniquitie; and predeſtinateth, neceſſitateth, and compelleth men vnto it. For Iuſtice, they giue him Iniuſtice, wherewith he iuſtifieth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious remaining impious, and damneth thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it not. And for fidelitie, they giue him infidelitie, wherewith he promiſeth that which he will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. And thus much of God: Now of Chriſt, God incarnate.</p>

                  <head>A SVMME OF THIS CHAPTER OF CHRIST.</head>
                  <p>In the former Chapter we shewed that Proteſtants crie that we make a new God, and that this fault rather falleth vpon them: now we will shew that they obiect the like vnto vs concerning Chriſt, and that themſelfes are faultie therein. M. Perkins in Cathol. reform. Controu. 9. cap. 11. thus writeth of Catholiks: <hi>They worshippe an other Chriſt then we doe.</hi> And in Conflictu Chriſti cum Diabolo tom. 2. col. 130. <hi>The Papiſts Chriſt, is a feigned Chriſt.</hi> In Apocal. 2. col. 189. <hi>The Papiſts Chriſt is a falſe Chriſt, yea</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Proteſtants new Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>an idol of Chriſt.</hi> But out of that which hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in this chapter, it will appeare, that the Catholiks Chriſt is the true Chriſt deſcribed vnto vs by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the Proteſtants Chriſt, is a quite different and oppoſite Chriſt. For the Chriſt which Scripture and Catholiks propoſe, is (as he is man) to be worshipped, to be called vpon, head of the Church, lawmaker, iudge, can forgiue ſinnes, worke miracles. None of which things agree to the Proteſtants Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>According to Proteſtants, Chriſt as man was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, moſt truely a ſinner, was afraied of his ſaluation: but not according to Catholiks: According to Scripture and Catholiks Chriſt merited ſome thing for himſelfe, truely merited our redemption, and that by his bodilie death or blood, nether was his blood corrupted: but according to Proteſtants, he merited nothing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, merited not our redemption with a iuſt price, but by acceptation of his Father, nor by his corporall death, but by ſome greater matter, and his blood was corrupted, nor is now any more in being. According to the Scripture and Catholiks, Chriſt died for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for the damned, for all, deſcended into hell, was free from infernall paines, entred to his diſciples the doores being shut, penetrated heauen, and there praieth
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:173883:87"/> for vs. None of which things agree to the Proteſtants Chriſt, and conſequently he is a farre different yea oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite vnto the true Chriſt deſcribed to vs by the holie Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Manifeſt alſo it is, that Proteſtants like true theues <note place="margin">Proteſtants take from Chriſt.</note> ſteale from Chriſt his due honour, becauſe the denie that as he is man, he is to be worshipped, to be praied vnto, that he is head of the Church, lawmaker, or <note place="margin">Honor.</note> iudge. They robbe him of his power, in denying that as <note place="margin">Power.</note> he is man, he can giue life, forgiue ſinnes, raiſe the dead, enter the doores being shut, penetrate the heauens, or worke any true miracle. They bereaue him of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <note place="margin">Knowledge.</note> for they denie, that as he is man he knoweth all things, knoweth the ſecrets of hearts, can heare our ptaiers, knew the kinde of tree, but had need to be tought as men are. They ſteale away his iuſtice or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: <note place="margin">Vertue.</note> for they teach that he was truely and moſt truely a ſinner, that as much as lay in him he refuſed to doe the office of a Mediatour, that he had vnconſiderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and contrarie to his vocation, that he behaued himſelfe vnciuilly towards his mother, confeſſed his delicateneſſe, let ſlippe a ſpeech of deſperation, nay was ouerwhelmed with deſperation and exceedingly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing. They take from him certaintie of ſaluation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Certaintie of ſaluation.</note> they ſay, that he was afraied of his ſaluation, and was almoſt perſwaded that he was vndone. They take <note place="margin">Worthe.</note> away worthines, in ſaying that nothing had beene done by his corporall death, but that there needed a greater price, that he could not merite to be iudge of the world, that with all his workes he merited not heauen, that he could not merite our redemption by a worthie price but by acceptation of his Father. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they ſpoile him of his goodnes and merite, becauſe they ſay that he died not for the wicked, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, <note place="margin">Mercie,</note> for all, but onely for ſome few elect, and that now he praieth not for vs in heauen. And if you take
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:173883:87"/> away from Chriſt as man his honour, his power, his knowledge, his iuſtice, his worthines, his certaintie of ſaluation, his goodnes, what remaineth of Chriſt as man, but the bare name of a Sauiour. Whereupon rightly ſaied Saint Auſtin: <hi>If we diligently conſider thoſe things which belonge to Chriſt, he is onely in name found amongſt any Heretiks whatſoeuer.</hi> But hitherto hauing treated of God and Chriſt, now let vs treate of Angels and Saints who happily raigne with him in heauen.</p>

                  <head>A SVMME OF THIS CHAPTER OF ANGELS or Saints.</head>
                  <p>It appeareth out of that which hath beene rehearſed in this chapter, that Proteſtants do farre otherwiſe deſcribe vnto vs Angels and Saints, then the holie Scripture and Catholiks doe. For according to the Scripture and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks they are perfectly iuſt and perfectly doe the will of God, but not according to Proteſtants. In the verdict of the Scripture and Catholiks, they pray for vs, haue care of our matters, heare our praiers: In the opinion of Proteſtants they do none of theſe. According to the Scripture and Catholiks, they are to be praied vnto, to be worshipped, to be imitated of vs, and God is to be inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by their names, who alſo for their good deeds, their ſake doth good vnto vs: but according to Proteſtants none of all theſe things belong vnto them. In the doctrin of the Scripture and Catholiks, they enioy their heauenlie felicitie, reigne with Chriſt, and ſome of them had power to doe miracles: but in the Proteſtants Doctrin they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enioy their heauenly happines, nor reigne with Chriſt, nor anie of them had or can haue power to worke miracles.</p>
                  <p>Proteſtants therefore ſteale from Angels and Saints <note place="margin">Proteſt. ſteale from Saints. Power. Virtue.</note> their power, whiles they denie, that they are capable of power to worke miracles: ſteale away their perfect iuſtice, in denying that they are perfectly iuſt or perfectly do the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:173883:100"/> will of God. Robbe them of their honour, becauſe they <note place="margin">Honor.</note> denie that we may honour them, imitate them, pray to them, or pray to God in their names. They ſpoile them <note place="margin">Dignitie.</note> of their dignitie, in ſaying that God doth not any good vnto vs for their merits or good deeds. They bereaue <note place="margin">Knowledge.</note> them of their knowledge, in ſaying that they know not any thing that is done on earth. They robbe them of <note place="margin">Charitie.</note> their charitie, becauſe they ſay, that they pray not for vs ether in generall or in particular, haue no care of vs, not exerciſe any offices of charitie towards vs. Finally they <note place="margin">Happines.</note> take from them their heauenly felicitie, becauſe they teach, that they enioy not that vntill the day of iudgment. And hitherto we haue ſpoaken of thoſe who are in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: now let vs ſpeake of theſe things which are on earth, and firſt of the word of God.</p>

For the holie Scripture together with Catholiks teacheth that in it are ſome things hard to be vnderſtood, that it cannot be vnderſtood without the light of the holie Ghoſt: that the Ghoſpell is or containeth a law: that it doth preach pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and good workes, reproueth ſinne, promiſeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vnder condition of good workes, and is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie vnto the law of God: that the law of Moiſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth faith in Chriſt: and that vnwritten traditions are to be obſerued: And Proteſtants defend all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
                  <p>They shew alſo, that Proteſtants ſteale from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">Proteſtants ſteale from Scripture.</note> her excellencie wherewith she ſurpaſſeth the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of mans wit: and from the Ghoſpell, that it contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth any law, preacheth pennance or good workes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth ſinne, promiſeth ſaluation vpon condition of well doing, and agreement with Gods law: whereby we ſee what a libertin Ghoſpell they bring in, to wit, ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth <note place="margin">Libertin Ghoſpell of Proteſtants.</note> no law, preacheth no pennance or good workes, reproueth no ſinne, promiſeth ſaluation without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of well doing, and is quite contrarie to the law of God: And that they ſteall from the law of Moiſes that it commandeth faith in Chriſt; and finally they take away all the vnwritten word of God.</p>

Peter and the Apoſtles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holie Scripture and Catholiks doe. For the Scripture and Catholiks teach that S. Peter was firſt of the Apoſtles: that he was the rock on which Chriſt built his Church, that he had the keyes of the kingdome of heauen, that his faith did not faile: All which Proteſtants denie. Beſides the Scripture and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks ſay, that the Apoſtles were foundations of the Church, were ſimply to heard without examining their doctrine, were ſufficient witneſſes of trueth; learnt diuers things of the holie Ghoſt: All which are denied by Prore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. Moreouer the Scripture and Catholiks ſay that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das was truely a diſciple and Apoſtle of Chriſt, and alſo a Bishop: which Proteſtants in like manner denie.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Proteſtants ſteale from S. Peter his honour, that he is the firſt of the Apoſtles; his authoritie, that he is the rock of the Church; and his power of the keyes and ſtedfaſtneſſe of faith. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt of the Apoſtles they ſteale that they were foundations of the Church, ſimply to be hearde, ſufficient witneſſes of truth, and that they learnt any thing of the holie Ghoſt.</p>

                  <p>The things which we haue in this Chapter rehearſed, do clearly shew, how differently Proteſtants beleiue of baptiſme from the Scripture. For the Scripture together withe Catholiks teacheth, that water and the inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holie Trinitie be neceſſarie to baptiſme: that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is neceſſarie by neceſſitie both of precept and of meane to ſaluation: that Simon Magus and reprobats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue whole baptiſme: that baptiſme is effectuall in the reprobates: that baptiſme cleanſeth ſinnes, but pardoneth not ſinnes that are to be done: that children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are in ſtate of damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before they be baptized: that Chriſts baptiſme is different from S. Ihons baptiſme: All which Proteſtats denie.</p>
                  <p>They shew alſo, that Proteſtants play the theiues with baptiſme, and ſteale from it the neceſſitie of water and of the inuocation of the holie Trinitie: the neceſſitie of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and meane to ſaluation: the integritie and efficacie thereof in the reprobates; the vertue of cleanſing ſinnes in anie whomſoeuer; the difference and excellencie aboue the baptiſme of S. Ihon: which being taken away, Chriſts baptiſme remaineth onely in name; and they likewiſe Chriſtians in name onely. Thus much of Baptiſme: Now of the Euchariſt.</p>

                  <p>Out of all which hath beene rehearſed in this chapter, it is cleare, how different an Euchariſt Proteſtants haue from that which the holie Scripture propoſeth. For the Scripture, and Catholiks with it, teacheth, that the holie Euchariſt is the true bodie and blood of Chriſt, that it is his teſtament: that Chriſts flesh is to be eaten, that whileſt the Euchariſt was inſtituted Chriſts bodie was giuen and his blood shedde for vs: that the chalice was shedde in remiſſion of ſinnes; that bread is a neceſſarie matter of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:173883:165"/> Euchariſt: that vnleauened bread is a couenient matter, and that we muſt prepare our ſelues to receaue the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt. Moreouer the Scripture teacheth, that there is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and altar in the Church, and that the Paſchal lambe (which was a figure of the Euchariſt) was ſacrificed: all which Proteſtants do denie.</p>
                  <p>It is cleare alſo, that Proteſtants do ſteale from the <note place="margin">What Proteſt. ſteale from the Euchariſt.</note> Euchariſt the trueth of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, the nature of his teſtament, the neceſſitie of bread, the conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie of vnleauened bread to make it of, and neceſſitie of our preparation to receaue it. They ſteale alſo eating and drinking from the flesh and blood of Chriſt, &amp; obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and shedding of them when the Euchariſt was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. And from the Church they ſteale both Sacrifice and altar, and ſacrificing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Paſchal lambe. And thus much of the Euchariſt: Now of the other Sacraments.</p>

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:173883:172"/> Matrimonie is a Sacrament, that one wife being put away it is not lawfull to marrie an other: that thoſe who lie a dying are to be anointed with oile: that our Sacraments are more excellent then thoſe of the ould law. All which are denied of Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>They alſo shew, that Proteſtants in this matter alſo keepe their ould cuſtome, and ſteale from Preiſts power to forgiue ſinnes; ſteale away the neceſſitie of confeſſing ſinnes to men: from the baptized they ſteale impoſition of hands, and from the impoſition of hands, vertue to giue grace: from Matrimonie alſo they ſteale the nature of a Sacrament, and the indiſſolubilitie thereof, from thoſe that die, their anoiling, and from all our Sacraments their excellencie and vertue aboue the Sacraments of the ould law.

                  <p>By thoſe things which haue beene rehearſed in this chapter, plainely appeareth, how different a faith Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants haue from the Scripture. For the Scripture together with Catholiks teacheth, that faith is a worke or action; that it beleiueth all the articles of faith or words of God, that it cannot be had without the holie Ghoſt, that it is but one, and diſtinct from hope and charitie, and inferiour to charitie: that it may be without confeſſion of mouth, and without charitie or good workes: that without good workes it is dead, and without them iuſtifieth not: that it iuſtifieth as it is beleife: that indeed it iuſtifieth: and that we do not onely thereby know that we are iuſtified: that it ſelfe may be imputed to iuſtice, that ſometimes it is perfect
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:173883:195"/> and is of great value before God: that it is neceſſarie to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and ſaluation: that it is not proper to the iuſt or elect: that it is gotten by hearing, that it may be loſt: and that reward is giuen to it. All which Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do denie.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth alſo, that Proteſtants play the theiues eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <note place="margin">What Proteſt. ſteale from faith.</note> towards faith which they would ſeeme to eſteme and and aduance more then all men, and ſteale from it, that it is a worke or action, that it beleiueth all things reuealed of God, that it is diſtinct from hope and charitie, that it is one, that it iuſtifieth as it is beleife, that it iuſtifieth indeed, that it is neceſſarie to iuſtification and ſaluation, that it can be perfect, that it can be imputed to iuſtice, that it can be rewarded, that it is a vertue or truely worthie of the name of vertue. And if we take from Faith the nature of a worke or act, the beleiuing of all that is reuealed of God, the vnitie and diſtinction from hope and charitie, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, power of iuſtifying, neceſſitie to iuſtification and ſaluation, worthineſſe of reward, nature of iuſtice or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and finally the very name of vertue, we ſcarce leaue the name of Faith much leſſe the thing it ſelfe. Nether one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do they ſteale ſo many and ſo great good properties fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Faith, but alſo attribute manie ill, which are contrarie to the nature of it: As that it is polluted with infidelitie, like to a ſcabbie or leprous hand, need pardon, and is ſinne.

                  <p>The things which we haue rehearſed in this chapter, do clearly shew, that Proteſtants teach farre otherwiſe of of good workes then Scripture doth. For the holie Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Catholiks with it, teacheth, that good workes of the iuſt are not ſinnes, are a ſweet ſauour before God, are intirely good, are iuſt or iniuſt, worthie, meritorious, vnequall, not all commanded of God, profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to iuſtification and ſaluation, cauſe of ſaluation, teſtimonie of iuſtice and election, a cauſe why God loueth vs: that we ought to do good workes, and for Gods glorie, and that we may alſo do them partly for reward. All which are denied of Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>They alſo shew, that in this matter of good workes <note place="margin">What Proteſt. ſteale from gooſt workes.</note> (if in anie whatſoeuer) Proteſtants playe the thieues and ſteale. For from the workes of ſinnes they ſteale all goodneſſe; And from the workes of the iuſt they ſteale intire goodneſſe, true goodneſſe, true iuſtice, ſweetnes, worth and merit before God, who iudgeth of them as they are indeed. They ſteale away alſo their neceſſitie and vtilite of iuſtifying and ſauing, their cauſalitie of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of Gods loue towards vs, their force of teſtifying iuſtification or election, our obligation to do them, and the end for which they are to be done, to wit, reward and Gods glorie. And conſequently they take out of the world, all true vertue or iuſtice, and the ſweetnes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and alſo the worth, the commoditie, the efficacitie, the teſtification, and end: and in their ſteed bring in mere ſinnes, mere iniquities, ſtenches, dung, vnpleaſant to God, vnworthie of God, and vnprofitable to vs, yea hurthfull
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:173883:218"/> and pernitious. And yet theſe men take it in euill parte to be called enemies of good workes, or that they ſpeake contemptuouſly of them. But how (I pray you) can they ſpeake more contemptuouſly of good workes, they <note place="margin">Proteſt. ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of good workes.</note> callling them, ill, ſinnes, mere ſinnes, mere iniquities, mere pollutions, ſtenches, and dung in the ſight of God, who iudgeth no otherwiſe of them then they are indeed? Or how can they be greater enemies of good workes, then by taking away or denying that there are any true good workes in the world, and by putting in their places their quite contraries, that is euill workes, and ſinnes?

                  <p>That which we haue related in this chapter euidently sheweth, that Proteſtants doctrine of good workes in particular is cleane contrarie to the doctrine of the holie Scripture. For the Scripture together with Catholiks tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that not to marrie is good and counſailed of God: that virginitie is a vertue, and better then the ſtate of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: that faſting is a vertue and worshippe of God, and an antidote againſt the Diuel, and that choice of meats is lawfull: that we may pray for the dead, for all, and for that which God hath not promiſed, and in ſtrange tongue, and that he that praieth may be heard for his owne or his praiers worth: that it is lawfull to ſell all, and giue to the pore; that almes deliuereth from death and ſinne; that pennance is commanded to all: that punishment of the bodie is a parte of pennance: All which Proteſtants denie.</p>
                  <p>They shew alſo, that Proteſtants ſteale quite away <note place="margin">Whatvertues Proteſt. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> manie particular vertues, and manie things alſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other vertues which they will ſeeme to leaue. For they take quite away the vertues of virginitie, of faſting, &amp; vowing: They take from praier, that it be made for the dead, for all, and for that which God hath not promiſed: They take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forſaking of goods, from almes the power of deliuering from death and ſinne, and from pennance the punishment of the bodie.

For the Scripture (and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks with it) teacheth, that ſinnes are imputed to the faithfull: that they are mortall to them as well as to others: that they ought to be ouercomen of the faithfull: that whoſoeuer ſerue ſinne, ſerue not God: that great ſinnes putte out grace, nor can ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with iuſtice: that they are to be redeemed with good workes: that to abſtaine from them, is neceſſarie to ſaluation: that they are the cauſe why men are damned: that we muſt giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them: that they are committed of the elect and that with full conſent: that vſurie is a ſinne, and that originall ſinne is a true ſinne.

For from God, from Chriſt, from Saintes, from the Church, from Sacraments, from good workes and other godlie and holie things they ſteale that which is good, vertuous, and worthie of praiſe and honour, that thereby they may not ſeeme ſo worthie to be loued and eſteemed of men: But from ſinnes they ſteale malice, all power of hurting the faithfull, in ſaying they are not imputed to them, caſt not them out of Gods grace, and ſuch like now rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to the end that they should not ſeeme ſo horrible and ſo much to be auoided of the faithfull: And thereby they shew themſelues to be freinds of ſinne, and precurſors of him who is termed: <hi>The man of ſinne.</hi> And thus much of <note place="margin">2.

                  <head>THE SVMME OF THIS CHAPTER OF iuſtification.</head>
                  <p>Out of that which we haue rehearſed in this chapter clearly appeareth, that the Proteſtants doctrine of Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is quite contrarie to the holie Scripture. For the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:173883:265"/> Scripture (and Catholiks with it) teacheth that iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of workes, and not of faith onely: that the iuſtified are iuſt indeed and before God: that they are cleane, and that the ſinnes from which they are iuſtified remaine not in them: that there is in them inherent grace or iuſtice, and that it is imputed to them: that they are not certaine by infallible faith that they are iuſtified: that pennance goeth before iuſtification: that iuſtification may be loſt, and that the iuſtified ought to feare leſt he fall: that iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not proper to the elect: that a ſinner cooperateth to his iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and that ſometimes after iuſtification temporall punishment remaineth: All Which Proteſtants denie.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth alſo, that Proteſtants euen in this matter keepe their ould cuſtome of ſtealing. For they take from iuſtification the vertue of abolishing ſinne in thoſe that are iuſtified, and of making them truely iuſt and cleane, and of giuing them internall iuſtice, and of making that it be imputed to them: They take alſo from it that it can be communicated to the reprobates.

For Scripture (and Catholiks with it) teacheth, that eternall ſaluation is a reward, a crowne of iuſtice, and cometh not of faith onely: that the ſoules of the reprobates do now ſuffer the paines of hell: that hell is a true place, and that the fire of hell is true fire: All which Proteſtants denie.</p>
                  <p>The ſame alſo proue, that Proteſtants ſteale from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation the nature of a reward, and crowne of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and dependencie of good workes: and ſteale from hell the nature of a place and true fire.</p>

                  <p>By what hath beene reported in this Chapter clearely appeareth, that Proteſtants teach quite contrarie to the holie Scripture concerning Gods lawe. For the Scripture together with Catholiks teacheth, that Gods lawe is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that ſome kept it; that ſome haue loued God in all their harte, that Gods lawe is in the harte of ſome, that we pray to fulfill it: that the keeping of it is neceſſarie to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and that the morall lawe of the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandments is not taken away from the faithfull: all which Proteſtants denie.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame alſo appeareth, that the Proteſtants alſo in this matter play the theeues. For they take from Gods lawe that it is poſſible, that it hath beene kept of anie, that it is in the hartes of anie, that it is neceſſarie to ſaluation, and that it obligeth the faithfull.</p>

                        <hi>But to teach, that the ſoules haue no feeling, is as much as to ſay, that they are perished, according to the verdict of the Proteſtants themſelues.

                     <p>Brentius apud Reginaldum cited in the firſt article: Yea ſuch wordes fall from diuers (Proteſtants) by which they ſignifie <note place="margin">No reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead.</note> that they beleiue not the reſurrection of the dead, as well when there are drunken as when they are ſober, in their familiar talkes.</p>

                     <p>Proteſtants plainely teach: that the more wittie the Gentils were, the more they laughed at the reſurrection, that the more learned men now are the more they thinke the reſurrection to be a fable: that Luther and Eraſmus were not free from this leauen, and that in this matter a faithfull ſoule is rare: that Schegkius openly denied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of this bodie, (which is indeed to denie all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, ſeing reſurrection is not but of the ſame which died) and yet was condemned of no Proteſtants, yea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of ſome: that manie of them both drunke and ſober let fall ſuch ſpeaches from them, as do shew that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue not the reſurrection of the dead: That amongſt the Sacramentaries two principall Apoſtles Caluin and Farel did not beleiue the reſurrection of this flesh, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not the reſurrection of the dead: that Sozinus was not ſatisfied about the reſurrection of the flesh: that manie of them denie the reſurrection of the blood: and laſty that they auouch that thoſe Chriſtians, who denied the reſurrection of the dead, fell not from true faith, not from the Church, or fauour of God.</p>

                  <p>What we haue rehearſed in this chapter plainely sheweth, that Proteſtants thinke farre otherwiſe of mans ſoule, then the holie Scripture doth. For the Scripture, and Catholiks with it, teacheth, that the ſoule of man is the forme of the bodie, is immortall, that there

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>IRST of all, we muſt conſider, that when the holie Scripture and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks both of purpoſe intend clearely to declare their meaning touching the foreſaied 260. articles in controuerſie, they do iumpe ether in the very ſelfe ſame, or inequiualent words: and that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scripture and the learnedeſt of the Proteſtants intend to expreſſe their meaning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſaied articles, they vſe quite oppoſite and contrarie ſpeaches. Which is a manifeſt ſigne, that the Catholiks doctrine about the ſaied articles is the ſelfe ſame with the doctrine of the holie Scripture, and the Proteſtants do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, quite contrarie thereunto. For ſithence this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Catholiks with the Scripture in words and ſpeach,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:173883:291"/> and diſagreement of Proteſtants in the ſame, falleth out ſo often and in ſo manie and weightie matters, it cannot be attributed to cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, becauſe cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as the Philoſophers <note place="margin">2. <hi>Phyſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> teach, is in thoſe things onely which fall out ſeldome: And therefore it proceedeth of the nature of theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences or doctrines, whoſe agreement or diſagreement with the ſentence of the holie Scripture, breedeth this ſo frequent agreement or diſagreement with the words or ſpeaches of the ſame. Wherefore thus I argue in forme of ſyllogiſme: Theſe doctrines, which when they are of purpoſe to be expreſſed clearely, diſtinctly, and as they differ from all other doctrines, do of their nature require to be expreſſed with the very ſame or equiualent words, are in deed one and the ſelfe ſame doctrine: And contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, thoſe doctrines, which when they are to be ſo expreſſed, of their nature require to be expreſſed with quite oppoſite and contrarie words, or ſpeaches, are in deed oppoſite and contrarie doctrines: But the Scriptures and the Catholiks doctrines touching the foreſaied 260. articles, are of the firſt kind, and the Scripture and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doctrines, of the ſecond: Therefore they are all one, and theſe, quite contrarie. The Maior of firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For how could twoe doctrines or opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of their nature require to be expreſſed with the ſelfe ſame or equiualent words, if there were any differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene them. For vndoubtely that difference would exact ſome difference in the words; and thoſe words which clearely and fully expreſſe the one doctrine, could not clearely and fully expreſſe the other. And much leſſe could one &amp; the ſelfe ſame ſpeach clearely expreſſely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, if they were contrarie one to the other. And therefore certaine it is, that twoe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie doctrines cannot of their nature require to be expreſſed by the ſelfe ſame or equiualent words. And conſequently alſo it is moſt certaine, that the Scriptures and Catholiks doctrines which touching theſe 260. articles of their nature require to be expreſſed with the ſelfe ſame or equiualent words, are not oppoſite one
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:173883:291"/> to the other. But thoſe doctrines, which when they are to be clearely and diſtinctly expreſſed, of their nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be expreſſed with oppoſite and contrarie ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, muſt needs alſo of their nature be contrarie one to the other. For els why should they of their nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be expreſſed by contrarie ſpeaches? And the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition which is betwene the ſpeaches, wherewith they require to be ſignified, riſeth of the oppoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is betwene the doctrines themſelues. The Minor or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition is proued. Firſt by the reaſon alreadie made: Becauſe it cannot come by chance, that in ſo manie and ſo weightie matters, when Catholiks and Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do of purpoſe clearely &amp; diſtinctly expreſſe their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, thoſe should agree in words and ſpeach with the holie Scripture, and theſe should diſagree. This agreement therefore and diſagreement in words, muſt needs riſe of the very nature of their opinions. Secondly, it may be proued by examples; but for breuities ſake I will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with one. That the Proteſtants opinion touching the Euchariſt; or that which Chriſt after his laſt ſupper gaue with his hands to be eaten, when it is clearely and dinſtinctly to be expreſſed, as it differreth from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik doctrine of the ſame matter, of it nature requireth to be expreſſed by a propoſition which is ſimply nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, appeareth manifeſtly: Firſt becauſe their opinion of that matter is ſimply negatiue, to wit, that it is not the bodie of Chriſt; And an opinion which is ſimply nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, requireth to be expreſſed by the like propoſition, ſuch as this is: <hi>This is not Chriſts bodie.</hi> Secondly, becauſe manie, and the learnedeſt of the Proteſtants, and often times, and in manie places, haue expreſſed their opinion of this matter by ſuch a propoſition, when they ment purpoſely to expreſſe it clearely and diſtinctly, as it deffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the Catholike doctrine, as I haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore c. 11. art. 1. who beſt knew, with what kinde of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition their opinion required to be expreſſed when it was moſt clearely and diſtinctly to be expreſſed, when it
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:173883:292"/> was moſt clearely and diſtinctly to be declared. And in the ſame manner it is euident, that the Catholik doctrine of this matter, of it nature requireth to be expreſſed by a propoſition which is ſimply affirmatiue, as this is: <hi>This is Chriſts bodie,</hi> becauſe their doctrine of this matter is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirmatiue, and becauſe Catholiks vſe to expreſſe their doctrine by this kind of propoſition. And that the doctrine of the Scripture concerning the ſame point, of it nature requireth to be expreſſed by a propoſition which is ſimply affirmatiue, is manifeſt, becauſe she foure times of purpoſe expreſſing her meaning of this matter, she vſeth a propoſition which is ſimply affirmatiue, and neuer vſeth a propoſition negatiue. Wherefore ether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture neuer expreſſed her meaning of this matter in ſuch a propoſition, as of it nature it required to be expreſſed withall, but alwaies by a contrarie kinde of propoſition, and then alſo when of purpoſe she ment to expreſſe her meaning moſt clearely and diſtinctly, or the Scriptures meaning touching this matter of it nature requireth to be expreſſed by a propoſition which is ſimply affirmatiue, as this is: <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> or, <hi>This is Chriſts bodie.</hi> And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is one and the ſelfe ſame kinde of propoſition, wherewith the Scriptures and Catholiks doctrine of this point requireth to be expreſſed, to wit, a propoſition ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirmatiue; and the propoſitions wherewith the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Scripture and of Proteſtants of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are to be expreſſed are quite oppoſite, to wit, the one ſimply affirmatiue; the other, ſimply negatiue; and the like are their meanings.</p>
               <p>But that the force of this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may better appeare, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Head from the numbers of articles in which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </note> I will deuide it into diuers heads. The firſt shalbe taken from the multitude of matters of articles in which Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do contradict the expreſſe words of Scripture, which are (as we haue ſeene) 260 and more. For though it may chance, that one once, or twiſe, or ſeldome may contradict the expreſſe words of an other, and yet not contradict his ſenſe or meaning, yet it can no way be
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:173883:292"/> thought, that this can fall out ſo often. Becauſe ſo great and ſo frequent oppoſition betwene their words, cannot (as I ſaied before) come by chance: therefore it muſt riſe of the oppoſition which is betwene their meaning. For how should their tongues ſo often iarre, whoſes myndes alwaies agree? How should they who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies meane the ſame, ſo often ſpeake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe? How should the ſame ſenſe and mynd, be expreſſed ſo often by contrarie ſignes?</p>
               <p>The ſecond head shalbe taken from the qualitie and <note place="margin">2. <hi>From the number of Proteſt. who doe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradict.</hi>
                  </note> multitude of Proteſtants who haue croſſed the expreſſe words of Scripture. For admit, that ſome one or few Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and thoſe not the leſt learned, should croſſe the expreſſe words of Scripture, and yet the Proteſtants do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine should not croſſe the true meaning of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet it is altogether incredible, that ſo manie, and ſo famous Proteſtants, should ſo often fight with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of Scripture, and yet their doctrine should not be contrarie to the meaning of the Scripture: For this their croſſing of the Scriptures words could not riſe of chance, becauſe it is in ſo manie Proteſtants; nor of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe they were the learnedeſt amongſt them, and therefore it proceedeth of the verie nature of their doctrine. And conſequently, their doctrine of it nature is oppoſite to the Scriptures doctrine.</p>
               <p>The third head is taken of the manner wherewith <note place="margin">3. <hi>From the manner in which they contradict.</hi>
                  </note> Proteſtants croſſe the expreſſe words of Scripture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, for the moſt parte, they croſſe them ſo directly, ſo plainely, ſo manifeſtly, as they croſſe the verie words of Catholiks, which of ſet purpoſe they contradict, or as euer anie Heretik croſſed the expreſſe words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or as anie man can croſſe them. Wherefore ether let them denie, that the contradict the meaning of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Trent, of D. Stapleton, or C. Bellarmin which of purpoſe they do contradict: or let them grant, that they contradict alſo the meaning of the holie Scripture: or els let them ſay, that the contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſenſes or meanings
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:173883:293"/> are not to to be gathered out of anie oppoſition in words, though neuer ſo great and manifeſt, but out of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Beſides, ether let them denie, that euer anie Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicted the true meaning of the Scripture, or let them graunt the ſame of themſelues; ſeing they haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times, as directly, and as euidently croſſed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of Scripture, and thoſe ſpoaken of purpoſe for to declare the Scriptures meaning, as euer anie Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike croſſed the Scriptures words. Moreouer, they not onely croſſe the expreſſe words of Scripture as ditectly and plainely as euer anie did, but alſo they manie times croſſe them in ſo manie and ſo different formes of ſpeach, as ſcarce anie, who would haue it knowne that he did contradict the Scriptures meaning, could diuiſe more manners how to contradict it.</p>
               <p>The fourth head, is taken out of the qualitie of the <note place="margin">4. <hi>From the qualitie of the words which they contradict.</hi>
                  </note> words of Scripture which Proteſtants do contradict. For they are expreſſe, formall, cleare, not obſcure nor doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and ſpoaken not by the way, but of purpoſe for to expreſſe the Scriptures meaning of thoſe matters, as is euident in all the articles. And what can be the true ſenſe of Scripture, if that be not, which ſuch kind of words do of themſelues moſt euidently afford? Or who can be thought to contradict the Scriptures true meaning, if he do not, who contradicteth the euident ſenſe of ſuch kind of words? Surely I doubt not, but if theſe words were written in anie other booke then in the Scripture, that the Proteſtants would confeſſe, that they contradict the ſenſe of them, as well as they contradict the ſenſe of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks words. For as S. Auſtin ſaied in the like caſe of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. mer. c.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>If I should ſpeake thus, theſe would oppoſe, and crie, that I ſpeake not well, I thought amiſſe: for they would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand no other meaning in theſe words of anie man who should speake them, but this, which they will not vnderſtand in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. From the ſenſe in which they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The fift head we will take from the ſenſe of thoſe words of Scripture which the Proteſtants contradict. For
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:173883:293"/> the ſenſe in which the Proteſtants oppoſe themſelues againſts the Scriptures words, is not forced or violent, but obuious, eaſie, open, and which the words of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues do plainely shew, and in which ſuch words vſe to to ſpoaken and vnderſtood of men. And euident it is, that all words ought to be vnderſtood according to ſuch a ſenſe and that ſuch a ſenſe is the true ſenſe of them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the contrarie be manifeſtly proued. For this is the verie rule of vnderſtanding words, which the <note n="†" place="margin">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnleſſe Proteſtants do euidently conuince, that thoſe words of Scripture which they contradict, are to be vnderſtood in an other ſenſe, then in that which of themſelues according to their ordinarie accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt men they beare, they cannot denie, but in contradicting this ordinarie ſenſe of the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they contradict the true ſenſe of them. And therefore the Reader in this matter muſt diligently marke, that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks are not bound to proue, that the words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or of Proteſtants be to be taken in their vſuall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie ſenſe amongſt men; but that this is to be ſuppoſed as a rule and vndoubted principle of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding words, vnleſſe the contrarie be demonſtrated: And if anie denie it, he is not to be admitted to anie diſputation which is grounded in words or teſtimonies, becauſe he denieth the verie firſt principle of vnderſtanding words, which being denied, all diſpute grounded on words is vayne. Wherefore that Proteſtants, who ſay that Catholiks do begge that point which they ought to proue, when they vrge, that the words of Scripture are to be vnderſtood according to the ſenſe which they openly shew, and in which men vſe to ſpeake and vnderſtand ſuch words, know not, what ought to be proued in diſputations out of words, and what is to be ſuppoſed as a principle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Whereupon Kemnitius himſelfe in Examen. parte 2.
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:173883:294"/> tit. de Miſſa. ſaieth: <hi>What madneſſe is it, to leaue the plaine ſenſe, which hath certaine and manifeſt teſtimonies of Scripture, and to deuiſe a new expoſition?</hi> And the ſame ſay other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as we shall rehearſe hereafter. <note n="†" place="margin">In Perorat.</note> But if Proteſtants will haue ether the words of Scripture, or anie other words whatſoeuer, to be vnderſtood in an other ſenſe, then that wherein they vſe to be vnderſtood of men, all the burden of prouing lieth vpon them. Which becauſe they cannot proue, we iuſtly conclude, that they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the true ſenſe of the words of Scripture which we before haue alledged, and frame this argument: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer contradict that ſenſe of the Scriptures words, which of themſelues they beare, and in which they are vſually vnderſtood of men, and cannot demonſtrate, that they are to be vnderſtood in an other ſenſe, they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the true ſenſe of the words of Scripture: But Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do ſo. Therefore they contradict the true ſenſe of the holie Scripture. The Maior or firſt propoſition, is (as I ſaied) the principle and ground of all diſpute out of words: and the Minor or ſecond propoſition is euident by the anſweres of Catholiks vnto the proofes which Proteſtants bring for to shew that the words of Scripture are to be vnderſtood in an other ſenſe, then they shew, or men vſually vnderſtand them in.</p>
               <p>The ſixt head is taken out of the circunſtances which <note place="margin">6. <hi>From the circunſtances of the words.</hi>
                  </note> make for the natiue and vſuall ſenſe of thoſe words of Scripture which Proteſtants contradict. For example: Chriſt ſaied ſimply of that which he gaue with his hands to his Apoſtles after his laſt Supper: <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> and the Proteſtants ſimply ſay of the ſame; <hi>This is not Chriſts bodie,</hi> and conſequently contradict Chriſts words not onely in their plaine, natiue, and vſuall ſenſe, but alſo which is confirmed by all their circunſtances, of end, of time, of place, of the ſpeaker, and of the hearers. As for the circunſtance of the end, it is plaine, that the end of theſe words was to tell clearely the Apoſtles what indeed that was which he then gaue them. And all his other
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:173883:294"/> words, were ether ſpoaken of other matters, or if of the ſame matter, yet they were ſpoaken to this end to tell the Apoſtles what it was which then he gaue them, but to what end they should vſe it, or for ſome ſuch like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And that the foreſaied words do clearly expreſſe, what that was which at that time Chriſt gaue to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, is ſo euident, as our aduerſaries themſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe. For thus <note n="a" place="margin">Admonit. vlt.</note> Caluin: <hi>I denie not, but Chriſtment to ſpeake moſt clearly.</hi> And <note n="b" place="margin">Cont.

                  </note> others confeſſe. The circonſtance alſo of the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the ſame: For it was the laſt when Chriſt was to conuerſe with his Apoſtles in humane ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was behouefull, that, if euer, he should then ſpeake in muſt plaine and vſuall ſenſe, eſpecially ſpeaking of a matter newly then inſtituted by him, and bequeathed by him, by his laſt will and teſtament, and neceſſarily to be knowne of them, and yet which could no waie be knowne of them but by Chriſts words. But euident it is, that the moſt cleare manner of ſpeaking, is to ſpeake in the plaine, natiue, and vſuall ſenſe of words, And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Chriſt, who by our aduerſaries confeſſion, ment to ſpeake moſt clearely, ſpeake in the plaine, natiue, and vſuall ſenſe of his words. The circunſtance of place alſo concurreth. For the place where Chriſt ſpoake theſe words, was free and void of ſtrangers, ſo that thereby no occaſion could be to meane otherwiſe then the words vſually did beare. The circunſtance alſo of the Speaker doth much confirme the ſame. For he was the word it ſelfe, the wiſdome of his Father, who both beſt knew how he ought to expreſſe his meaning about a new thing which could not be knowne of vs but by his words, &amp; was moſt deſirous that we should know what it was, and that
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:173883:295"/> we should rightly vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his meaning. Finally Chriſts hearers do conteſt the ſame.

                  </note> of the matter of the foreſaied articles, in which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants contradict the expreſſe words of Scripture: toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Proteſtants want of the like oppoſite words of Scripture, which may ſeeme expreſſely and without any inference or expoſition of Proteſtants, to teach as Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doe. For the matter of the foreſaied articles partely is ſuch, as the very light of reaſon doth ſee, that it is ſo as the expreſſe words of Scripture doth teach it to be: to wit, That God willeth not, doth not, commandeth not ſinne: That he tempteth not, nor prodeſtinateth men to ſinne, that he iuſtifieth not the impious remaining impious, that good workes are neceſſarie to ſaluation, and the like: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely is knowne to be ſuch by verie experience, as, That a man hath free will in good and badde, that he cooperateth to his conuerſion, that faith is an act of man, and ſuch others: Partely it is new, neuer heard of before, and farre beyond the reach of all reaſon, as is the Euchariſt, and manie more. Now Proteſtants, in all kinds of matter <note place="margin">What kind of words Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. want.</note> which is in controuerſie, and almoſt in all the foreſaied articles, want expreſſe words of Scripture, which were of purpoſe ſpoaken to declare what a thing was, and which, of themſelues, plainly, and directly without any inference or expoſition of men, may ſo much as ſeeme to ſay, that it is ſo as Proteſtants teach. Seing therefore that <note place="margin">What kind of words Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks doe bring.</note> in all kind of matter in controuerſie, and in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaied articles, Catholiks do bring both expreſſe words of Scripture, and ſpoaken of purpoſe to declare what we ought to beleiue touching that article, and which plainely and directly according to their natiue and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall ſenſe amongſt men without any inference or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition added to them, pronounce that it is ſo as
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:173883:295"/> Catholiks teach, and that the light of reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience alſo conteſt the ſame ſenſe in ſuch matters as they can reach vnto: And that Proteſtants in none or very few articles can bring anie ſuch expreſſe words of Scripture, which may ſo much as ſeeme to be ſo plaine <note place="margin">What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. oppoſe againſt the expreſſe words of Scripture.</note> for them, as thoſe are for Catholiks, but in all, or all moſt all the ſaied articles, onely bring their inferences or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thoſe compoſed at leaſt of one humane prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and that in matters which humane reaſon no way can reach vnto, it is mere madneſſe to forſake the doctrine the doctrine of the Catholik Church, holie Fathers, and Councels, and the moſt expreſſe words of Scripture in all the ſaied articles, and the very light of reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience it ſelfe in manie of them, and to harken to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, conſequences, and humane arguments of a few, new, and diſagreing Heretiks. For example: Seing the Euchariſt, as it is a matter of faith, to wit, a Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of Chriſt, and a guift giuen of him to the Church (whether it be onely a ſeale of grace, as Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts would, or the true bodie of Chriſt, as Catholiks beleiue) is a new thing, inſtituted firſt of Chriſt, and neuer heard of before, nor falleth vnder the reach of ſenſe or reaſon, but onely of faith, and is ſuch as Chriſt would haue it to be; is it not <note place="margin">Madneſſe to follow mens conſequences rather then Gods words.</note> madneſſe, to gather what it is, rather by the humane infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences or arguments compoſed of ſome few, new, and diſagreing men, of one humane principle at leaſt, then by Chriſts owne words, and thoſe moſt expreſſe, and ſpoake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him purpoſely for to tell vs moſt clearely what he would haue the Euchariſt to be? For who well in his witts will perſwade himſelfe, ether that theſe men by their humane arguments perceaue better, what a thing, which falleth not vnder reaſon, is, then Chriſt who inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted it: or that they know better what Chriſt would haue it to be, then Chriſt himſelfe: or that they expreſſe Chriſts meaning more clearely by their arguments and conſequences quite oppoſite to Chriſts words, then he hath done by his owne expreſſe words ſpeaking by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:173883:296"/> of purpoſe for to declare his meaning: or finally, that Chriſt expreſſeth his meaning concerning the Euchariſt, by a humane principle no where deliuered of him, and a humane argument neuer made of him, and that alſo dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly oppoſite to his owne expreſſe words, better then by his owne moſt expreſſe and cleare words, and thoſe of purpoſe ſpoaken for to expreſſe clearely what he would haue the Euchariſt to be? Can any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleiue, that a few, new, and diſagreing men do vnderſtand the ſupernaturall matters of faith better then God himſelfe; or that they declare better what they are by their humane inferences and arguments compoſed of humane principles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himſelfe doth by his owne expreſſe words ſpoaken by him of purpoſe for to declare what they are? what it is to preferre mans word before Gods word, and man before God, if this be not?

The Catholik faith (by the aduerſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <note place="margin">What Caluin oppoſeth againſt the expreſſe word of God.</note>) is grounded vpon the expreſſe and plaine words of God: Caluins faith relieth vpon his guift of interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his ſtudie, the ſuggeſtions of his ſpirit, his reaſons, which he dare oppoſe, yea prefer, before the expreſſe word of God. But we demand, that ſeing we haue for vs the expreſſe word of God, wherewith Gods will touching the Euchariſt is made manifeſt, he produce the like word of God, whereby it may be made manifeſt, that the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts haue the guift of interpretation rather then the Catholiks, or the Lutherans, or anie ſorte of Chriſtians; or that that guift of interpreting which interpreteth Gods expreſſe words, ſpoaken by him of ſupernaturall matters of purpoſe to declare what they are contrarie to their vſuall ſenſe, is the guift of God. But if he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce anie ſuch word of God, it were ſtarke madneſſe to forſake Gods expreſſe word, and the plaine meaning thereof, which beſides Sacramentaries all Chriſtians els
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:173883:297"/> do embrace, and to follow a guift of interpretation ether vncertaine, or feigned. Beſides, Proteſtants do banish the guift of infallible interpretation out of the Church, in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that she may erre in matters of faith and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture, why then do they in this matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch a guift, and oppoſe it againſt Gods expreſſe words?

For what greater darkneſſe can be caſt vpon light, then in expreſſe words ſpoaken of purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare a matter, and by which a new doctrine is deliuered, a new Sacrament inſtituted, a laſt will is made, and which were ſpoaken of the Maiſter of trueth, vnto his diſciples, when he was to forſake them, to expound <hi>Is,</hi> by, <hi>Is not:</hi> and, <hi>Body giuen for you,</hi> by <hi>A bare figure or Signe thereof.</hi> And thus we haue heard what Caluin oppoſeth againſt Gods expreſſe word: now let vs ſee how he would diminish the force and authoritie of the ſame.</p>

<pb n="604" facs="tcp:173883:298"/> For thereby it would haue appeared more clearelie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Catholiks or Proteſtants find the better weapons in the Scripture. But he addeth: <hi>Yet ſuch a word, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites had, when they made God to haue a bodie.</hi> Yea ſuch a word, as thou or anie Chriſtian hath, when he maketh God to haue beene incarnated, to haue ſuffered, to haue riſen againe, and to haue aſcended to heauen; and (as I dare ſay) a clearer word alſo, if the words themſelues and the foreſaied circunſtances be conſidered. So that <note place="margin">Differences betwene the Cath. and the Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites.</note> more iuſtly may anie Heretik, who denieth the foreſaied myſteries, obiect to thee, the example of the Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites, then thou canſt obiect it to vs in this myſterie. For the Anthropomorphites in no place of Scripture had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> an expreſſe word, which directly ſaied <hi>God hath a bodie:</hi> We haue a moſt expreſſe word, wherewith Chriſt ſaied moſt directly of that which he gaue to his Apoſtles: <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> The Anthropomorphites had no expreſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> word, which was of purpoſe ſpoake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tell vs what God was: we haue an expreſſe word ſpoaken purpoſely to this end, and onely to this end, to tell vs what the Euchariſt is. The Anthropomorphites had no expreſſe word, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> anie circunſtances of moment did conuince to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in their proper ſenſe: we haue an expreſſe word, which all circuſtances do confirme ought to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in their natiue and vſuall ſignification. The Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> had a word, but as a thing, which the very light of reaſon did shew to be otherwiſe then the word did ſignifie: we haue the word, of a new thing, neuer heard of before, and which can no way be knowne by the light of reaſon, but onely by the word of God. Finally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> (to omit al other differences taken from the Church, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and Councels) the Anthropomorphites had the word of a matter, which the Scripture other where moſt manifeſtly denieth: we haue the word of a matter which <note place="margin">

Thus manie and thus great differences are there betwene the word, wherewith we make the Euchariſt the bodie of Chriſt, and the word wherewith the Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites made God to haue a bodie, as I thinke are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the word which the Anthropomorphites alledged, and the word wherewith anie other article of Chriſtian faith is proued.</p>
               <p>And thus much touching the firſt argument taken from the oppoſition betwixt the words of the holie Scripture and of Proteſtants in 260. articles, and ſuch words of the Scripture as were ſpoaken of purpoſe for to tell vs what we were to beleiue, and in their open and plaine ſenſe, which they manifeſtly shew, and in which ſuch words vſe to be ſpoaken and vnderſtood of men: which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a foundation of all the reſt that follow, shalbe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in euerie one of them.</p>

And howſoeuer Proteſtants, <note place="margin">The Cath. aduantage ouer Proteſt.</note> will delude this argument, they muſt needs confeſſe, that Catholiks haue the aduantage of them, in that Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts produce no teſtimonie which forceth Catholiks to reiect anie booke which anie Father teſtifieth to haue beene anciently held of the Church for Canonicall, as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks produce the teſtimonie of S.

               </head>
               <p>IN the former chapter, we ſaw how Proteſtants were forced to reiect a good parte of the holie Scripture, now we shall ſee, how they deale with that parte which they ſeeme to admit, by adding to it, by detracting from it, by changing ſome words, by calling others in doubt, by falſe tranſlating ſome, by changing the order of others, and ſuch like dealings. And let the Reader note, <note place="margin">What falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Scripture are here touched.</note> that whereas Proteſtants corrupt the words or ſenſe of holie Scripture for twoe ends, whereof the one is, that it may ſeeme to make for them: the other is, that it may not ſeeme to make againſt them; I will in this, and the next chapters relate onely their faſhions of corrupting the Scripture that it may not ſeeme to make againſt them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe make more to my purpoſe, which is to shew that Proteſtants contradict the true ſenſe of the holie Scripture: And by that which shalbe ſaied of this their manner of corrupting, it will eaſily be gathered, what their other manner of corrupting Scripture is. Let him alſo note that I intend not to bring all the examples of Proteſtants corrupting Scripture in anie kind whatſoeuer, but onely ſo manie as may ſuffice to proue, that they vſe to corrupte Scripture in ſuch ſorte. For as Tertullian ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued l.

                  <hi>dotage, affirming that the bread which we break is the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the bodie of Chriſt.</hi> The like he hath 4. Inſtit. c. 17. §. 15. and others after him: And neuertheleſſe, the Scripture neuer ſaieth directly of the Euchariſt: <hi>This is bread,</hi> as four times it ſaieth moſt directly of it: This is Chriſts bodie: Nether doth it in anie place reſtraine the word, <hi>Bread</hi> when thereby it ſignifieth the Euchariſt, to the proper ſignification of materiall bread, as it doth manie waies reſtraine the word <hi>Bodie</hi> to ſignifie the true bodie of Chriſt, by adding that it is the bodie giuen deliuered or broken for vs. Moreouer the Scripture it ſelfe Ioan. 6. clearely expoundeth, that when by the word <hi>Bread</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Euchariſt, it meaneth the very flesh of Chriſt. So that in the ſelfe ſame matter, that word which is ſaied of the Euchariſt in an identicall ſpeach ſaying, <hi>This is this,</hi> and which ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times and moſt clearely is tied to it proper
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:173883:307"/> ſignification, nor is euer expounded in Scripture to be otherwiſe taken, muſt not be vrged againſt Proteſtants, becauſe it maketh againſt them; and an other word, which nether is euer ſo ſaied of the Euchariſt, nor is any way reſtrained to it proper ſignification, yea which the Scripture it ſelfe expoundeth figuratiuely, muſt be vrged, becauſe it ſeemeth to fauour Proteſtants: and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the letter or word of Scripture is to be vrged, or not vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, according as it fauoureth or disfauoureth Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Which is indeed to shape the Scripture to their opinions, not to frame their opinions to the Scripture.</p>
               <p>But if they cannot obtaine, that the letter of the holie <note place="margin">They call it begging of the queſtion, to vrge the letter.</note> Scripture be not vrged againſt them, they take an other courſe to delude the authoritie or force thereof. For they call the open and plaine ſenſe of it into controuerſie, and then crie, that it is the begging of the queſtion to argue againſt them out of a ſenſe which is controuerted. Thus do the Proteſtants, when we vrge againſt them the words of the Euchariſt, as yee may ſee in Zuinglius in Exegeſi to. 2. fol. 338. Ad Epiſtol. Amici fol. 322.

               <p>Thirdly if they dare not ſay, that the words which <note place="margin">They deuiſe manie ſenſes.</note> make againſt them, haue an other ſenſe, then that which they clearely afford, yet they will deuiſe manie ſenſes, and ſay; that it is vncertaine in which of thoſe ſenſes the words are to be vnderſtood, and conſequently that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be certainely gathered of them. Thus dealeth Kemnice in Exam. tit. de Baptiſmo pag. 69. Where hauing brought manie expoſitions of the word <hi>Baptiſme</hi> Actor. 19. Whence we proue, that the baptiſme of Chriſt was different from that of S. Ihon, thus at laſt he concludeth: <hi>Nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be proued out of places, that are obſcure, ambiguous, and in controuerſie.</hi> Indeed if thoſe places muſt be counted ſuch, of which it hath pleaſed new Hheretiks to deuiſe diuers ſenſes; Let them giue the like libertie to other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks, and they shall ſee how much they will preuaile againſt them by any words of Scripture whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Their fourth shift is, that when the words of Scripture <note place="margin">They will haue Gods meaning ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of by places, then out of proper.</note> which are ſpoaken purpoſely of anie matter, make againſt them, they will not haue the queſtion to be denied by them, but ether by words which are not ſpoaken at all of that matter, or but incidently and by the way, and will haue theſe to be the rule of expounding to others, and ſo gather the ſenſe of Scripture rather out of a ſtrange place then out of the proper place. Thus the Sacramentaries will haue the queſtion of the Euchariſt to be tried rather out of the 6. of S. Ihon (though commonly they teach that there Chriſt ſpoake not of Euchariſt) or out of words which ſpeak of Chriſts aſcenſion into heauen, or out of words which ſpeake of the end of the Euchariſt, then out of thoſe which purpoſely and which onely ſpeake of the ſubſtance of the Euchariſt.

Who not onely in ſo manie and ſo great matters contradict the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of Scripture: but alſo in manie and great points are compelled to forſake the letter thereof, to call the manifeſte ſenſe into queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſay that it is a begging of the queſtion, to argue out of it to deuiſe manie new ſenſes for to reiect a place as ambiguous, and to ſay that the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſe of Scripture is to be gathered rather out of a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge then out of the proper place where it is purpoſely hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, who finally deride the very kind of arguing out of the expreſſe words of Scripture and openly blaſpheme them, they are to be thought not onely to gainſay the true ſenſe of Scripture, but alſo to contemne the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and God himſelfe.

But charitie beleiueth all things, and therefore is deceaued, which is farre from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith.</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, S.

               <p>MY ſixt argument shalbe, becauſe Proteſtants are driuen to ſay, that Scripture ſpeaketh not according to it owne mynd and according to trueth, but according to the errour and opinion of others, and that in manie and great matters, as of faith, of good workes, of ſacraments, of the very meane of attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſaluation and the like.</p>

               <p>Thou ſeeſt (Reader) how often and in how manie, and weightie matters Proteſtants are forced to turne the moſt generall or vniuerſall ſayings of the Scripture into particulars, and how manie vniuerſall particles both affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue, as <hi>All, Euerie one, Euerie creature, As manie, Whole, As long time, Who, Anie man, Anie thing</hi> and Negatiues, as <hi>Not anie, Neuer, No fornicator, No murderer,</hi> they change into particulars, whenſoeuer they make againſt them.

               <p>THE eleuenth argument for to proue that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants contradict the true ſenſe of holie Scripture, shalbe becauſe they are ſometimes forced to change conditionall propoſitions thereof into abſolute, and to delude them diuers other waies.</p>
               <p>For if we proue that our freindshippe with God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth of our keeping the commandements, becauſe Chriſt ſaied conditionally Ioan. 15. v. 14. <hi>Yee are my freinds, if yee doe the things that I command yee:</hi> Caluin. ibid. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth: <hi>He meaneth not, that we obtaine ſo great honor by anie merit of ours, but onely admonisheth vs, vpon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he receaueth vs into fauour and vouch ſafeth to reckon vs amongst his freinds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this wilbe more euident by that we shall shew in the next chapter how they of cauſall propoſitions make no cauſall.</p>
               <p>Diuers others waies they delude and fruſtrate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of holie Scripture. For if they can by anie colour they expound them of onely faith, or of the holie ghoſt: So they delude thoſe places: Ioan. 6. verſ. 53. <hi>Vnleſſe yee eate the flesh of the Sonne of man and drinke his blood, yee shall not haue life in yee:</hi> and Ioan. 3. ver. 5. <hi>Vnleſſe a man be borne agayne of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God:</hi> Which teach that Sacraments are neceſſarie to ſaluation. Or if they muſt needs expound them of good workes, they will not expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of doing all neceſſarie good workes and auoiding all neceſſarie
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:173883:330"/> euill, but of ſome onely or in parte, or of endeauor to doe or auoid them: ſo they delude thoſe ſayings of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rom. 8. v. 13. <hi>If you liue according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the ſpirit you mortifie the deeds of the flesh you shall liue.</hi> Caluin. ib. <hi>He promiſeth vs life, if we endeauour to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the flesh. For he doth not exactly require the death of the flesh, but onely biddeth vs endeauour to tame the lustes thereof.</hi> And the like he doth in manie other places, as may be ſeene hereafter c. 16. And in like manner they delude all other ſentences of Scripture which teach, that if we wilbe ſaued or iuſtified, we muſt doe good workes and eſchew euill. And according to this they ſay, that we muſt doe ſome good, or haue ſome good workes: that we muſt haue a begun or imperfect newneſſe of life, and keepe the lawe in ſome ſorte or fashion: Luther in Iſaiae 8. to. 4. f. 83. <hi>The holie Ghoſt is giuen that we may ſatisfie the law in ſome parte.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In ſome parte.</note> And in Pſal. 51. to. 3. fol. 455. <hi>We will fulfill and keepe the law, but with a large, that is, with a true Euangelicall dispenſation.</hi> Confeſſio Saxon. c. 9. <hi>It is needfull that there be ſome obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi>

                  <hi>in thoſe that are iuſtified.</hi> Schluſſelb. to. 4. Catal. p. 176. <hi>The iuſtified are free from the accuſation and damnation of the law, not from beginning of obedience.</hi> Bucer in Rom. 8. <hi>Chriſt giueth that ſpirit whereby we auoid ſinne in ſome ſorte.</hi> Pareus l. 3 de Iuſtif. p. 645. <hi>Saints doe not doubt of ſome kind of inherent iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:</hi> and l. 4. c. 7. <hi>It is enough if we endeauour to begin the new obedience of the law according to all the commandements.</hi> So that whereſoeuer the Scripture ſaieth conditionally: If thou wilt be iuſtified or ſaued doe this or doe not that, they vnderſtand it with a large diſpenſation: that is, doe ſomewhat, or doe not ſomewhat of it: or begin or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to doe or not doe it.</p>
               <p>But if this shift will not ſerue, becauſe the Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth conditionally of keeping the whole law, as Math. 9. v. 17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the commandements;</hi> and the like, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſay it is the doctrine of the law not of the Ghoſpell. Caluin ib. <hi>We gather, that this anſwere of Chriſt is according to the law.</hi> Illyricus in Claue part. 2. tract. 6. col.
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:173883:331"/> 543. <hi>That all be bound vnder payne of loſſe of eternall life to doe good and auoid ſinne, is a ſentence of the law, and muſt and ought to be corrected and reſtrained by the</hi> (Proteſtant) <hi>Ghoſpell or by remiſsion of ſinnes.</hi> Peter Martyr in Rom. 11. <hi>That ſaying: Forgiue, and it shalbe forgiuen, is a precept, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the law.</hi> Melancthon in Apologia tom. 3. c. de ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentis: <hi>The promiſe of reconciliation and of eternall life is free, but proper legall promiſes are added for workes: as who shall giue a draught of water, shall not want his reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore thus I frame my eleuenth argument.

               <p>MY fourtenth argument shalbe taken from that Proteſtants are forced to expound the ſayings of Scripture of a different time from that of which Scripture ſpeaketh, and that in manie and great matters.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If we proue that God doth now cleanſe vs from all iniquitie, becauſe it is ſaied. 1.

               <p>If we proue, that we muſt be borne againe both of water and of the holie Ghoſt, by theſe words Ioan. 3. v. 5. <hi>Vnleſſe one be borne againe of water and the holie Ghoſt &amp;c.</hi> Caluin. ib. anſwereth: <hi>It is one ſimple ſentence: that we muſt be borne a new, for to be Gods children, and that of this ſecond birth the holie Ghoſt is author.

               <p>Wherefore this is my 15. argument.

               <p>Finally Luther was ſo bould as to ſet downe a Canon <note place="margin">Luthers Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of expounding Words by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note> of expounding the words of holie Scripture by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traries. For thus he writeth in Pſ. 5. to. 3. fol. 171. <hi>Let this be a Canon for thee: Where the Scripture commandeth a good worke to be done, do thou ſo vnderſtand it, that it forbiddeth thee doe good workes, ſeing thou canſt not, but that thou maiest ſanctifie the Lord, be dead and buried, and ſuffer God to worke in thee.</hi> Which Canon Proteſtants do well follow, as appeareth by what hath beene related in this chapter, and before in the ſixt and ſeuenth chapter, where we shewed that in the weightieſte matters they expounded the words of holie Scripture ironically, and according to others me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mynde.</p>
               <p>Theſe and innumerable the like doe Proteſtants, of which we might eaſily gather not onely a chapter, but a booke full. But out of theſe which we haue rehearſed, it
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:173883:350"/> clearely appeareth: Firſt how great <hi>hereticall libertie</hi> (as Tertullian ſpeaketh) is, which turneth the words of holie Scripture this way, and that way, in to this forme and that, and toſſeth them vp and downe like tenis balls. Secondly how eaſie it may be for euerie idiote with this libertie for to defend what hereſie ſoeuer though neuer ſo contrarie to Scripture. For who cannot expound the words of Scripture, by diuerſe, by diſparate, and contrarie things. Thirdly, how impoſſible it is, if this libertie be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to refute by Scripture any hereſie at all, or to proue anie thing by anie words whatſoeuer ether of God or man. Fourthly how that Proteſtants by this kinde of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, do more dishonor God and the holie Scripture, then if they should quite reiect it. For if they should reiect the Scripture, they should onely reiect Gods word and trueth: But by this manner of dealing they doe not onely reiect Gods trueth and meaning, but alſo in ſteede thereof foiſt in the contrarie vntrueth: and ſo (as S.

                  </note> of the word of God, they make the word of the Diuel. Fiftly it appeareth that theſe expoſitions of Proteſtants are like to that which Luther merly deuiſed for to shew the Sacramentaries how they expounded the words of conſecration, in Defenſ. verb. cenae. to. 7. fol. 384. where he <note place="margin">A fit exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Proteſt. expoſitions.</note> writeth thus: <hi>Surely they doe a great and weightie matter: But no otherwiſe, then if I should denie that God made heauen and earth, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one should obiect that of Moiſes: In the beginning God created heauen and earth, I should expound Moiſes words in this ſorte: God, that is, a Cuccou: Made, that is, deuoured: Heauen and earth, that is, a Hedge ſparow all and whole: It not this a trick of arte? Yes ſurely not vnknowne nor vnſemely to ſtage plaiers.</hi> Thus Luther, who as being beſt practiſed in this arte, could beſt of all others deſcribe it. Finally it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that Proteſtants haue not onely forged a new faith, but alſo a new tongue, a new Grammar, a new frame of ſpeach. For concerning Propoſitions, they bidde vs vnderſtand an Affirmation by a Negation, and a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by an Affirmation, and words they bidde vs expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:173883:351"/> by diuerſe, by diſparate, and contraries to theſe which they ſignifie with other men. And this new Grammar of theirs Luther acknowledgeth in theſe words. Gal. 3. tom. 5. fol. 345. <hi>Thoſe words, To doe, To worke, are to be taken</hi>

Syſtem. Theol. p. 445. <hi>There are manie that ſay, There is no figure nether in the Predicate, nor in the verbe, but in the connexion of the Predicate with the Subiect, that is, in the forme of this propoſition.</hi> Polanus in Sylloge theſ. part. 1. de Caena. <hi>There is a threfould figure in theſe words. This is &amp;c. Synechdoche of the gender, a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, and a metonymie of the Subiect.</hi> Ramus in Schluſſelb. l. 1. Theol. Caluin. artic. 22. will haue three figures in theſe words. Aretius ib. ſaieth, that this ſpeach of Chriſt, <hi>is ether metaphoricall, or catachreſticall, or metonymicall.</hi> Pencier ib. <hi>In theſe words of Chriſt, ether there is a metaphor, or a meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymie, or a ſynechdoche, or alleoſis.</hi> Et Zuinglius in Hoſpin. part. 2. f. 143. <hi>Theſe words: This is &amp;c. are not to be vnderſtood naturally, and in the proper ſenſe of the words, but ſymbolically, denominatiuely, and metonymically.</hi> Thus (as Tertullian ſaied <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore I argue thus in the 21. place. Who beſide their foreſaied oppoſition to the expreſſe words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doe alſo in ſo manie and ſo weightie matters delude the proper ſenſe of the words of Scripture by ſo manie kinds of figures, they contradict the true ſenſe of the holie Scripture.

               <p>THE 22. argument which we will make for to shew, that Proteſtanrs contradict the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the holie Scripture, is becauſe they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to deuiſe manie diſtinctions friuolous, voluntarie, contrarie to themſelues, and neuer heard of before.</p>
               <p>Their friuolous diſtinctions are of this ſorte. <hi>Dauid ſinned indeed, but neuer committed ſinne: It is an other thing to ſinne, and an other, to commit ſinne.</hi> As we related lib. 1. c. 16. art. 12.</p>

               <p>Voluntarie diſtinctions I call thoſe, by which for their <note place="margin">Voluntarie diſtinctions.</note> pleaſure they draw the ſame words into diuerſe ſenſes. As when the Scripture biddeth vs loue God with all our heart, then they will haue that <hi>with all the heart,</hi> ſignifieth all kind of degree of loue, ſo that this precept be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs: but when it ſaieth, that anie hath loued God with all the heart, then they will haue, <hi>with all the heart,</hi> to ſignifie onely ſincerely and without hypocriſie. So Caluin in Actor. 8. v. 9. Pareus l. 1. de Iuſtif. c. 10. l. 2. c. 7. and others. In like ſorte, when the Scripture. 1. Cor. 11. affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Euchariſt to be the bodie of Chriſt, then the word Bodie is taken for a figure; But when in the ſame place, it ſaieth, that vnworthie receauers are guiltie of the bodie of Chriſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is taken for the true bodie of Chriſt. And ſo of innumerable other words, which they expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d diuerſely as it pleaſeth them.</p>
               <p>Their diſtinctions which deſtroie themſelues are of <note place="margin">Diſtinctions deſtroying themſelues.</note> this ſorte. Pareus. l. 4. de Iuſtific. c. 4. diſtinguisheth ſtipend, into a free ſtipend, and a due: and ſaieth, that eternall life is a free ſtipend, but not due. As if it could be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, how a ſtipend could not be due. Like to this is their diſtinction of reward, into due and vndue. For if it be no waies due, it is no reward, but a mere gift. Whereupon Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. Inſtit. loc. 32. ſaieth: <hi>Reward properly is nothing els, but which is giuen of debt.</hi> Et Scarpius de Iuſtif. Controu. 15. <hi>In morall matters, where there is reward, there is merit.</hi> Muſculus in locis titul. de Meritis. <hi>Surely there can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but in reſpect of merit.</hi> Yea and Pareus himſelfe in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oem. l. 5. de Iuſtific. <hi>Reward properly called, is due.</hi> The ſame man. l. 4. cit. c. 10. addeth: <hi>that iuſt men can fulfill the law by an inchoate fulfilling, but not by a perfect.</hi> Which he repeateth. c. 13. as if there could be a fulfilling which is onely inchoate or begun. And neuertheleſſe by this diſtinction doe they
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:173883:356"/> delude all thoſe teſtimonies of Scripture, which teach, that ſome doe fulfill the law, loue God, doe good workes, and the like. Which they interpret of an imperfect fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, louing, and doing. Beza in Dial. cont. Heshuſſ. vol. 1. ſaieth: <hi>The fathers before Chriſt were one thing with the flesh of Chriſt, then to come, but not actually.</hi> And in Colloq. Montisbel. p. 27. <hi>We confeſſe, that Chriſt God and man, was not actually a man, before his reall incarnation, yet we ſay, that he was truely preſent to theſe Fathers.</hi> And p. 63. <hi>I will not ſay, that Chriſts bodie was not at the time Abraham. For it was, but not actually.</hi> Gerlachius to. 2. diſp. 17. <hi>Noë indeed was perfectly iuſt: but not abſolutely iuſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as for diſtinctions neuer heard of before, they haue deuiſed innumerable. For as it appeareth by what <note place="margin">Diſtinctions vnheard of. Of God.</note> hath beene related lib. 1. cap. 2. they diſtinguish of God, that he will ſinne for ſome other end, but not for it ſelfe: That he willeth, that is, decreeth it, but not willeth, that is, not approueth it: That the hidden God willeth death, but not the reuealed: That he will haue all to be ſaued, by his reuealed will, but not by his hidden will: or as ſpeaketh Beza part. 2. reſponſ. ad Colloq. Montisbel. <hi>He will haue all ſaued by his open will, but not by his pleaſure.</hi> And agayne: <hi>He will not the death of a ſinner, by his open will, but by his ſecret will.</hi> That he inuiteth all to him by words, but not by his mynd: That he punisheth the faithfull leſt they ſinne, not becauſe they haue ſinned: that he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth a wicked man remaining wicked, by the Ghoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, not by law: And manie other ſuch diſtinctions as may be gathered out of the ſaied chapter &amp;c. To which I adde theſe. Beza cont. Heshuſ. vol. 1. <hi>Alie pleaſeth God, not as it is a lie, but as it is a iust punishement.</hi> Muſculus in locis titul. de iuſtific. God iuſtifieth a wicked man abiding ſuch, in his throne of grace, not in his throne of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Tilenus in Syntagm. cap. 46. <hi>God iudgeth iust mens workes to be good according to the Ghoſpell, not according to law.</hi> Perkins in Apoc 2. tom. 2. <hi>Gods reuealed will hath with it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned a condition, but not his ſecret will.</hi>

               <p> Touching Chriſt; they diſtinguish, that he is a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinner <note place="margin">Of Chriſt.</note> by imputation, but not by inherence: That he died for all, but not for euerie one: That ſometime he ſpeaketh as others thought, not as himſelfe: That he is a lawmaker, head of the Church, to be adored, to be inuocated, can forgiue ſinnes, and worke miracles, not as man, but as God onely. See more l. 1. c. 3.</p>
               <p>Of Saints: they diſtinguish in this new manner. They <note place="margin">Of Saints.</note> wish for vs heauen, but pray not: we may wish that they praied for vs, but may not pray: They pray for vs in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, but not in particular: They may be worshipped of vs after a ciuill or profane ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, but not after a religious. And as Perkins ſaieth in Cathol. reform. Contr. 14. cap. 2. <hi>When Angels appeared, they were lawfullie honored, but not now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching Scripture; they haue coined theſe new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions: <note place="margin">Of Scripture.</note> 
                  <hi>In Paulſome things are hard, not of themſelues, but by accident.</hi> So Reineccius to. 1. Arm. c. 10. <hi>In Scripture there are ſome things hard to be vnderſtood and obſcure to vs, though all the Scripture be in it ſelfe cleare.</hi> So Pareus in Gal. 2. lect. 25. <hi>The Ghoſpell, teacheth good works, not of it ſelfe, but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweth the doctrine of workes from the law.</hi> So the ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus Colleg. Theol. 9. diſput. 39. <hi>The Theſſalonians tooke not vpon them to iudge, or to debate whether Gods trueth were to be admitted, but onely examined Pauls doctrine according to the toucheſtone of Scripture:</hi> So Caluin. act. 17. verſ. 13. As if Paules doctrine and Gods trueth were not all one. <hi>The Ghospell in a moſt large ſenſe is taken for the whole doctrine of Chriſt and the Apoſtles: Largely, for the doctrine both of grace and faith, and of repentance and new obedience; but ſtraitely and properly for the doctrine of grace by faith:</hi> So Pareus l. 4. de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtif. c. 3. Finally the Scripture ſpeaketh as the law, not as the Ghoſpell; by which diſtinction they delude manie places of Scripture, as is to be ſeene in Luther de ſeru. arbit. to. 2. f. 449. Caluin in Math. 19. verſ. 17. Pareus. l. 4. de Iuſtif. cap. 2. Schluſſelb. to. 8. Catal. p. 441. &amp; to. 2. p. 270.</p>
               <p>Of S. Peter and the Apoſtles, they haue inuented theſe <note place="margin">Of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</note>
                  <pb n="723" facs="tcp:173883:357"/> new diſtinctions. S. Peter is firſt of the Apoſtles in order, not in iuriſdiction: The Apoſtles are foundations of the Church, as thoſe that found the Church, not as thoſe on which it is founded: or as Iunius ſpaketh Cont. 3. l. 1. c. 10. <hi>The Church is founded vpon Peter as vpon a pillar, not as on a foundation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of Paſtors they diſtinguish: That authoritie is in the <note place="margin">Of Paſtors.</note> word which they preach, not in themſelues: That they gouerne the viſible Church, but not the Catholike: That in caſe of neceſſitie, they are made without miſſion, but not otherwiſe. See l. 1. c. 7.</p>
               <p>Of the Church: they haue brought in theſe new di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions <note place="margin">Of the Church</note> That for profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, there is one Church viſible, an other inuiſible: That she is infallible in funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points, but not in others: That she is to be heard when she preacheth Scripture, but not otherwiſe: That she is the pillar to which trueth is faſtened, not on which it relieth: So ſaieth Riuet. Tractat. 1. ſec. 39. Or as Andrews writeth in Reſp. ad Apol. Bellar. c. 14. <hi>She is ſo the pillar of trueth, as that she relieth vpon trueth, not trueth vpon her. That the Church is neceſſarie to beleiue the Scriptures, not to know them.</hi> So whitaker lib. 3. de Script. 396. <hi>That the Church is the ſtaye and pillar of trueth, not the foundation of trueth.</hi> Heilbruner in Colloq. Ratisb. ſeſſ. 7.</p>
               <p>Of the Sacraments: they diſtinguish in this ſorte: They iuſtifie as ſignes or ſeales, not as cauſes: They are receiued <note place="margin">Of Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</note> whole and intire of the good, but not of the badde: that <hi>baptiſme is the lauer of regeneration, paſsiuely, not actiuely:</hi> So Daneus. Contr. 2. c. 12. <hi>That baptiſme is but one taken wholy, but is twoe, taken by partes:</hi> So Beza. part. Reſp. ad Acta p. 44. <hi>That the Church is cleanſed ſignificatiuely by the baptiſme of water, but really by the baptiſme of the spirit.</hi> So Beza. ib. p. 115. or as Polanus ſaieth in Diſp priu. p. 37. <hi>Sinnes are ſaied to be blotted out by baptiſme, not properly, but in a figuratiue ſenſe.</hi> The ſame Beza in Hutter in Analyſi. p. 54. ſaieth. <hi>I neuer ſimply ſaied, that baptiſme was the obſignation of regeneration in children, but of adoption.</hi> Perkins in Galat. 3. <hi>By baptiſme,</hi>

                  <hi>actuall guilt is taken away, but not potentiall.</hi> Pareus in Gal. 2. lect. 23. <hi>Abſolutely we are all borne ſinners, but in regard of the couenant, we are borne Chriſtians or Gods confederats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Euchariſt: they haue theſe diſtinctions: That it <note place="margin">Of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</note> is the ſymbolicall bodie of Chriſt, but not his true bodie: That Chriſt his flesh killed doth profit vs, but not eaten: That it is exhibited in the Supper according to the vertue thereof, not according to the ſubſtance: That when S. Paul ſaieth. 1. Cor. 11. <hi>He eateth iudgement to himſelfe,</hi> he meaneth not of damnation but of correction: So wolfius in Schuſſelb. l. 1. Theol. art. 25. In like ſorte they ſay, that Preiſts forgiue ſinne indirectly not directly; directly as it is an offenſe of the Church, indirectly as it an offenſe of God. So Spalata. l. 5. de Repub. c. 12.</p>
               <p>Of faith: they make theſe diſtinctions: That one is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike <note place="margin">Of Faith.</note> or vniuerſall, or hiſtoricall, an other, ſpeciall. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that <hi>one is abſtract, naked, ſimple, an other, concrete, compounded, incarnate.</hi> So Luther in Gal. 3. to. 5. <hi>That there is one habituall and actuall, of men: an other potentiall and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiue, of infants:</hi> So Pareus l. 3. de Iuſtif. c. 14. or as Polanus ſaieth. part. 2. theſ. p. 651. <hi>Infants haue not altogether the ſame faith that men haue, yet they haue ſome thing proportionable.</hi> Piſcator in Theſibus. l. 2. pag. 252. <hi>Adam before his fall had not iuſtifying faith:</hi> or as Pareus writeth l. 1. de Amiſſ.

And in like ſorte they diſtinguish of the iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, to wit, that it iuſtifieth relatiuely or correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, not abſolutely, and as an inſtrument, not as it is a worke. Bucanus in Inſtitit. loc. 3. <hi>Faith is ſaied to be imputed</hi>

Theol. 2. diſp. 10. <hi>We are ſaied to be iuſtified by faith, but not formerly nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoriouſly, but organically.</hi> Touching the loſſe of faith, they thus diſtinguish: Zanchius in Supplication. citat. <hi>The elect looſe faith in parte, but not wholy.</hi> Beza in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. 2. part reſponſ. ad Acta: <hi>Faith ſometimes ſleepeth, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeemeth to be quite loſt, but yet is not loſt.</hi> Agayne: <hi>There is a lethargie of faith, but no loſſe: The feeling or vſe of faith is lost for a time, but not faith it ſelfe.—Some reprobates do beleiue with a generall and hiſtoricall faith common to the Diuels themſelues.</hi> Tilenus in Syntagm. capit. 43. <hi>The faithfull become ſometimes outliers; but not runawaies or forſakers.</hi> In like ſorte they ſay, that faith without works at the time of iuſtification is not dead, but at other times, if it be without workes it is dead. Likewiſe Reineccius tom. 4. Armat. cap. 15. ſaieth. <hi>Faith is called a worke not abſolutely, as it is conſidered in it ſelfe, but relatiuely, as it apprehendeth Chriſt.</hi> Hunnius de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificat. pagin. 157. <hi>Faith worketh by charitie towards our neighbour, not toward God.</hi> Finally Perkins in Caſibus c. 7. <hi>That which euerie one is bound to beleiue, is indeed true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intention of God who bindeth him: but it is not true alwaies according to the euent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of good works in generall: they coyne theſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: <note place="margin">Of good works in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> The good workes of the iuſt are good in parte, not wholy: They are all equall before God, but not in themſelues. They are acceptable to God in his throne of mercie, but not of iuſtice.

For thus Whitaker. Contr. 4. quaeſt. 1. cap. 3. <hi>That rule is much to be eſteemed: That in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie no diſtinctions are to be allowed, but ſuch as are proued by plaine paſſages of Scripture:</hi> And lib. 2. de Concupiſc. cap. 7. <hi>We may ſay and defend what we will, if ſuch diſtinctions be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi> Sadeel ad Repetit. Sophiſm. Turriani: <hi>It is a theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall rule: All diſtinctions in diuinitie muſt be proued by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe places of Scripture.</hi> The like hath Perkins l. de Caena. to. 1. col. 861. and others.</p>
               <p>Their moſt vſuall diſtinctions wherewith moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly <note place="margin">Moſt vſuall diſtinctions with Proteſt.</note> they delude the teſtimonies of Scripture, are theſe, though perhaps all of them vſe not the verie ſelfe ſame termes. To wit: <hi>Before men, not before God:</hi> or which cometh all to one: <hi>It ſeemeth ſo, but is not:</hi> By this diſtinction they delude all thoſe teſtimonies of Scripture, which teach that reprobate or euill men may beleiue, doe good workes,
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:173883:361"/> be in the Church, that reprobates may be iuſtified, that good workes doe iuſtifie, redeeme ſinnes or the like: Which they expound, before men, not before God, or in shew, not in deed. An other vſuall diſtinction of theirs is: <hi>In it ſelfe, or in an other thing.</hi> By this they delude thoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Scripture, which ſay that good men are iuſt, worthie of God, fulfill the law, that baptiſme forgiueth ſinnes, Almes deliuereth from death, and ſuch like, which they expound, in an other, not in themſelues: as that good men are iuſt, worthie of God, fulfill the law, in Chriſt not in themſelues: that almes deliuereth from death, not in it ſelfe, but in faith, as ſaieth Confeſſio Auguſtana. c. de Implet. legis, and that baptiſme remitteth ſinnes not in it ſelfe but in faith. So Caluin in Act. 2. v. 38. A third vſuall diſtinction of theirs is, <hi>Significa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly not Cauſally:</hi> By this they delude thoſe teſtimonies of Scripture, which teach that Sacraments worke grace, Preiſts remit ſinnes, good works doe iuſtifie, doe cauſe life euerlaſting, and the like. Which they expound <hi>Significantly or oſtenſiuely, not Cauſally.</hi> Their fourth accuſtomed diſtinction, is <hi>In parte, not ſimply or wholy,</hi> Thus they delude thoſe teſtimonies which auouch that there is inherent iuſtice, that ſinners are taken away, that good mens good workes are good, and ſuch like, which they expound, In parte, not ſimply or wholy. Their fift vſuall diſtinction is: <hi>A ſaying of the law, not of the Ghospell.</hi> Thus they delude all the ſentences of Scripture, which declare that iuſtice and life euerlaſting is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by good works, that the keeping of the law is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to life, and ſuch like. For theſe kind of ſayings, they will haue to be onely of the law not of the Ghoſpell. But their moſt vſuall diſtinction of all is. <hi>Figuratiuely not Properly:</hi> which kind of deluding the Scripture is moſt ample and containeth almoſt all the former kinds. For what ſeemeth to be, &amp; is not, is figuratiuely not properly. Likewiſe what is in parte, and not ſimply, what is not in it ſelfe but in another, is figuratiuely and not properly. Yet becauſe this their diſtinction would wax ſtale, if it were
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:173883:361"/> vſed vnder the ſame termes in all places, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie thereof would eaſily appeare if nakedly it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ſome places, therefore at leaſt in words and with ſome litle differences they haue deuided it into diuers. Peculiarly by this diſtinction they delude all thoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture, which teach that the Euchariſt is the bodie and blood of Chriſt, that eternall life is a reward, that the Apoſtles are the foundations of the Church, that the Ghoſpell is a law, Chriſt a law giuer, deſcended into hell, that there is in the Church an altar, a ſacrifice, and the like. Theſe forſooth are their fine plaiſters which they applie to cure all the wounds which are giuen them by the ſword of the word of God, which if they will let other Heretiks vſe in ſuch ſorte as they doe, nothing at all will be proued out of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thus I frame my 22. argument. They who beſides their oppoſition to the expreſſe words of holie Scripture related in the firſt booke, are forced in manie and great matters to deuiſe friuolous and verball diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and ſuch as deſtroye themſelues, and were neuer heard of before among Chriſtians, they contradict the true ſenſe of holie Scripture.

               <p>Thus thou ſeeſt Reader, that Proteſtants confeſſe, that in manie and great matters, the Fathers, the ancient, all Fathers, all from the Apoſtles time, the ancient Fathers with mutuall conſent, all antiquitie: likewiſe, the ancient Church, the Church of the firſt 500. or 600. yeares, the Church in the very beginning: Finally generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, all generall Councells are oppoſite to them: and that the Catholik doctrine doth conſiſt of the ſentences of the Fathers, hath beene beleiued and receaued ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, and all deliuered by the Fathers with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſent. Moreouer thou ſeeſt, how litle they eſteeme the vniforme conſent of Fathers, Church, and Councells, yea in plaine termes profeſſe to contemne it. I diſpute not now, how the vniforme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of Fathers, of the Church, and Councells is infallible in matters of faith: which hath beene manifeſtly proued by many Catholiks writers, onely I propoſe to the Readers conſideration, how much <note place="margin">Note.</note> Proteſtants doe preiudice their cauſe in the iudgement of all reaſonable men, by reiecting and contemning the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent of Fathers, of the Church and Councells, touching the expoſition of Scripture. Forſooth yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> contemne moſt ancient; few, very manie; diſagreing, thoſe that moſt agree; men of meane wit or learning, thoſe that were moſt wittie and learned: men of ſmall dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, thoſe that haue beene moſt diligent: vulgar, yea profane
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:173883:365"/> men, thoſe that were moſt holie: nether will admit ſuch and ſo manie men now happily reigning with Chriſt, who nether knew vs nor them, ſo that could not be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, ether for iudges, or arbiters, or witneſſes ſufficient of the ſenſe of Scripture, but quite reiect them as inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to decide this controuerſie. Surely hereby it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the ſenſe which Proteſtants attribute to the Scripture, is not euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently no point of faith, ſeing ſo manie, ſo learned, ſo wittie, ſo holie, ſo diligent ſearchers of Scripture in ſo manie ages could not finde it. For as Andrews ſaieth in Tortura Torti: <hi>It is monſtrous, if among ſo manie eyes, eagles eyes, eyes dayly conuerſant in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (I adde eyes lightened by the holie Ghoſt) <hi>none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued this ſenſe grounded as they ſay must plainely—If it had beene moſt plainely grounded, I thinke ſome Father would haue ſeene through a lattiſe at leaſt he would not haue denied it, and taught the contrarie:</hi> Yea it followeth that the ſenſe in which Catholiks expound the Scripture: is manifeſt, ſeing ſo manie and ſo great Fathers haue vniformely deliuered it, nor deliuered it onely, but alſo condemned thoſe who followed that ſenſe which the Proteſtants embrace, as Heretiks, as shall appeare in the Chapter following. I adde alſo that Caſaubo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his epiſtle to Card Perron thus writeth: <hi>The King will willingly graunt, that now it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">No end of controuerſies without the Fathers.</note> 
                  <hi>for anie to condemne thoſe things, which are euident to haue beene approued by the Fathers of the firſt ages by an vniforme conſent for good and lawfull.</hi> Agayne: <hi>If the teſtimonie and weight of the primitiue Church be taken away, the King wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly graunteth that amongst men the controuerſies of theſe times will neuer haue an end.</hi> Luther alſo in Defenſ. verb.

               </p>
               <p>In forme therefore thus I make my 23. argument Who not onely gaineſay the expreſſe words of holie Scripture in ſuch ſorte as hath beene ſet downe in the former

               <p>As for the hereſies of Origen, thus writeth Spalatenſis l. 5. de Repub. c. 6. n. 44. <hi>Origen was shroudly taxed of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus, becauſe he held that the Sacraments did not worke ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by the worke (as I may ſo ſpeake) wrought, but onely by the worke of the worker, and that God doth not vſe materiall and inſenſible creatures to importe ſanctification to men.

               <p>A third end was to cleanſe vs from ſinne. Tit. 2. v. 14. <note place="margin">Nor cleanſed ſinne.</note>

               <p>A fourth end was that we might be truely ſanctified, <note place="margin">Nor truely ſanctified vs.</note> and become holie and immaculate in the ſight of God.

See l. 1. c 18 art. 1. To theſe I adde, that thus writeth Perkins in Gal. 1. v. 3. <hi>It is the fault of our age; that all profeſſe Chriſt, yet manie admit not Chriſt but their owne deuiſes, to wit, a Chriſt who muſt be a Sauiour to deliuer them from hell, but not a Lord to giue them commandements, this they cannot ſuffer.</hi> But Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as we shewed l. 1. c. art. 7. denie Chriſt to be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer or Lord to giue commandements, according to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins admit not Chriſt, but their owne deuiſes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thus I make my 26. argument.

               </head>
               <p>MY 27. argument, that Proteſtants contradict the true meaning of holie Scripture shalbe, becauſe they take away the encouragements to vertue, yea all vertue out of the world, and in place of them put allurements to vice and remoue the impediments thereof.</p>
               <p>They take away encouragements to vertue: becauſe as <note place="margin">Proteſt. take away encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to vertue.</note> we shewed l. 1. c. 2. art. 13. they teach, that God careth not for good workes. art. 14. that he is not honored with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. art. 16. that he is not appeaſed with them: And c. 14. Art. 6. that there is no dignitie or worth in them. Art. 7. that there is no reward promiſed to them. Art. 10. that all good workes are equall before God. Art. 12. and 13. that they are not neceſſarie to iuſtification or ſaluation. Art. 15. that they are not cauſe of ſaluation. Art. 16. Not ſo much as a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of iuſtification or ſaluation. Art. 18. that we ought not to doe them. Cap. 17. artic. 15. That a ſinner doth not cooperate to his iuſtification. Cap. 18. art. 1. That ſaluation is no reward or retribution. Art. 2. No crowne of iuſtice. Art. 3. That it is of faith onely. And cap. 21. art. 1. That our will is not free in morall works. Art. 3. That it doth not cooperate with the grace of God to good works. But who can denie, but that Gods fauour towards good works, their worth and reward, their efficacie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie to iuſtification and ſaluation, mans freedome and cooperation to acts of vertue and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be great ſpurres and encouragements to vertue.

               <pb n="759" facs="tcp:173883:375"/>
               <p> They take alſo away all vertue. For firſt they denie <note place="margin">to fulfill the law.</note> diuers particular vertues, as faith, the roote of all vertue, which they ſay is vitious and vnworthie the name of vertue l. 1. c. 13. art. 12.

They takeaway alſo praier for all men art. 8. Vows art. 14. and Eremiticall life. art. 15. Beſides, they takeaway all inherent iuſtice. c. 17. art. 8. and denie, that the iuſtified are truely iuſt. art. 3. or cleane art. 4. but retaine ſinne in them art. 5. Finally they take away all vertue. For they teach, that all the good works of ſinners or of good men are ſinnes, yea mere ſinnes c. 14. art. 1. and 2. that they are filth, du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gge, and ſtinke in the face of God art. 3. But if all <note place="margin">If all good workes be ſinne there can be no vertue.</note> good works be ſinnes, and mere ſinnes, ſurely there is no vertue at all. For (as Whitaker ſaieth. l. 2. de Pec. orig. c. 14.) <hi>Tell vs, how ſinnes can be good workes.</hi> Which is much more true, if they be mere ſinnes.</p>
               <p>They ſet alſo allurements to ſinne. For as is shewed l. <note place="margin">Proteſt. ſet allurements to ſinne.</note> 1. c. 2. art. 1. they teach, that God willeth ſinne. art. 2.

               <head>CHAPTER XXVIII. <hi>THAT PROTESTANTS HAVE NO infallible interpretation of Scripture.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE 28. Argument to proue that Proteſtants muſt needs contradict the true ſenſe of holie Scripture, is becauſe they haue no ſure and infallible means to attaine to the true meaning thereof. But before we proue that they haue no infallible mean to come to the right ſenſe of Scripture, we muſt proue that Scripture (at leſt in ſome points of faith) needeth ſome means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret or expound it, to wit, ether becauſe no where it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth ſome points of faith ſo clearely, that the onely words thereof ſufffice to captiuate the vnderſtanding: or becauſe, though ſome where it deliuer clearly enough ſome points of faith, yet other where it ſeemeth ſo to teach the contrarie, as without ſome infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter it would ſeeme vncertaine whether of the twoe it did teach.</p>
               <p>That therefore Scripture doth not of it ſelfe teach <note place="margin">That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture needeth an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> clearely all points of faith, ſo as it need no interpreter for that purpoſe, I proue firſt out of the Scripture it ſelfe. For the holie Eunuch did read the Scripture ſpeaking of the paſſion of Chriſt Actor. 8. and yet being asked of Philip whether he vnderſtood what he read, anſwered: <hi>And how can I, if none shall shew me.</hi> You ſee, that the Scripture did not clearely foretell the paſſion of Chriſt, as that a pious man by the onely words thereof without an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter could vnderſtand the meaning thereof. And Luk. vlt. v. 27. <hi>And beginning from Moyſes and all the Prophets, he did interprete vnto them in all the Scriptures the things that were concerning him.</hi> Et v. 45. <hi>Then he opened their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they might vnderſtand the Scriptures.</hi> But if Chriſts diſciples did not vnderſtand the Scriptures which ſpoake
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:173883:378"/> of him, and the Apoſtles had need that Chriſt should open their vnderſtanding for to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Scriptures, it is euident that the Scriptures by themſelues doe not ſo plainely teach all matters of faith, as they need no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation for to be rightly vnderſtood of the faithfull. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 2. Pet. vlt. it is ſaied, that in S. Pauls epiſtles <hi>there are ſome things hard to be vnderſtood.</hi> And that theſe hard things do containe points of faith, is cleare; both becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe they should be limited to other things, as alſo becauſe it is added, that the learned and vnſtable doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue theſe hard things to their owne deſtruction: but ſuch things are eſpecially matters of faith. Moreouer, if the Scripture did ſo clearely teach all points of faith, that for them it needed no interpreter, it would follow, that the guift of interpretation had beene ſuperfluouſly giuen to the Church for to expound Scripture in matters belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly I proue this out of the Fathers: but for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities ſake I will content my ſelfe with one teſtimonie of S. Auſtin: He lib. de Vtil. cred c 7. to one that ſaied: <hi>When I read the Scriptures, by my ſelfe I vnderstood them:</hi> thus anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wereth: <hi>Is it ſo? Without ſome skill in poetrie thou dareſt not read Terentian Maurus. Aſper, Cornutus, Donatus, and manie more are neceſſarie for to vnderſtand anie Poet, and thou falleſt vpon thoſe bookes without a guide, and dareſt giue thy opinion of them without a teacher.</hi> Loe how plainely he ſaieth, that we can not vnderſtand the Scriptures by our ſelues, and by how familiar an example he proueth it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I proue it by the verie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For <note place="margin">Proteſt. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that Scripture alone ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not.</note> thus writeth Whitaker Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 1. q. 4. c. 1. <hi>When Bellarmin ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this to be the ſtate of the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Whether the the Scripture by it ſelfe be ſo cleare, as without anie interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſufficeth of it ſelfe to determine and decide all controuerſies of faith, he figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth without an aduerſarie, for ſurely in this point we are not againſt him.</hi> Agayne: <hi>They ſay, that we thinke (but falſely) that all things in Scripture, are plaine, and that they without anie interpretation are ſufficient to determine all controuerſies.</hi> without

For doubtles they meane that, as well of ſuch places of Scripture wherein points of faith are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, as of others: &amp; this Caluin 4. Inſt. c 17. §. 25. clearely enough inſinuateth, where, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Catholiks obiected, that they had the word of God wherein he affirmeth that the Euchariſt is his bodie, he anſwereth: <hi>Indeed, if they may ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the guift of Interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the Church.</hi> Wherefore he thinketh, that there is in the Church the guift of Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation euen for to expound Scriptures touching points of faith, ſuch as the Euchariſt is. Furthermore Pleſſie. l. 3. de Eccl. c. 3. writeth, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie of Schiſme ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be properly decided by the Scripture, becauſe it is rather a queſtion of fact, then doctrine. If therefore Scripture by it ſelfe can determine nether the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Schiſme, nor yet all controuerſies of faith, it is manifeſt, that the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome is neceſſarie, and that alſo infallible, becauſe fallible interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to put vs out of doubt. And ſurely Proteſtants muſt needs teach, that Scripture by it ſelfe alone, is not ſufficient to decide all controuerſies of faith, both becauſe els it had decided all controuerſies amongſt themſelues, or betwene anie that are not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; as alſo becauſe ſcarce in anie controuerſies that are betwixt vs and them, Scripture doth ſo much as in shew directly and immediatly giue ſentence for them, but they haue need to conferre places, and adioyne thereto ſome humane principle, and make an argument, for to draw in what manner ſoeuer their doctrine out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:173883:379"/> which conference of places, adiunction of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane principle, and diſcourſe, ſeing it is not made by the Scripture, but by Proteſtants by their guift of Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they muſt needs graunt, that the Scripture hath need of Interpretation for to determine all the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that are betwixt vs and them. And for this cauſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <note place="margin">Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Proteſt. will haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when conſequence thereof.</note> when they put vs to the proofe, they vſe to crie, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be beleiued which is not expreſſely in Scripture; yet when they are to proue, they will haue it ſuffice, that it may be gathered out of Scripture by good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence. For ſo ſay the Lutherans in Colloq. Ratisbon. Seſſ 3. &amp; 13. Kemnice in 1. part. Exam. p. 320. Beza in Reſp. ad Acta Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisb. part. 2 p. 46. &amp; l. de Notis Eccleſ. Daneus Cont. 1. p. 86. Pareus l. 1. de Iuſtif. c. 16. Piſcator de Iuſtif. l. 1. c. 5. Riuet. in Contr. tract. 1. ſect. 18. and others commonly. And ſeing this Inference by good conſequence is not made by the Scripture, but by themſelues, by their Interpretation, they muſt needs ſay, that beſides the Scripture there is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie ſome Interpreter for to know all points of faith.</p>
               <p>Now that Proteſtants haue no infallible interpretation of Scripture, is manifeſt: Firſt, becauſe they confeſſe, that <note place="margin">Proteſt. haue no infallible interpreter.</note> that they haue no infallible Interpreter of Scripture. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus in Colleg. Theol 2. diſp. 1. <hi>The word of God cannot abide anie infallible Interpreter beſides God himſelfe who inſpired the Scripture.</hi> Secondly, becauſe they denie that the whole Senate of Fathers, the Catholik Church or generall Councels haue the guift of infallible interpretation in all points of faith, and therefore ridiculouſly should they arrogate this guift to themſelues. And ſeing they teach, that all Paſtors, together, and all the true Church (whichſoeuer it is) may erre in matters of faith, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chalenge to their Paſtors this infallible guift. Thirdly, for if they doe infallibly interprete the Scripture in all points of faith, ether they doe it by means, or without means. Not without means: for ſuch interpretation were Propheticall by immediate reuelation from God, or rather Enthuſiaſticall by illuſion from the Diuel. Whereupon ſaieth Whitaker Cont. 2. q. 4. c. 5. <hi>If the holie Ghoſt teach the</hi>
                  <pb n="767" facs="tcp:173883:379"/> 
                  <hi>Church to interprete theſe places of Scripture without means,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Proteſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire means to interprete.</note> 
                  <hi>this is Enthuſiaſticall, and Anabaptiſticall, and extraordinarie. For the Spirit teacheth now onely by meanes, nether muſt we now looke for new inſpirations or reuelations.</hi> Et Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 1. q. 5. c. 9. <hi>Now must we treate of the mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to finde the ſenſe of Scripture. For ſith the Scripture hath not a liuely voice for vs to heare, we muſt vſe ſome means for to finde out which is the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture.</hi> Agayne: <hi>The Church hath alwaies vſed ſome means for to expound the Scripture.</hi> But if they expound the Scripture by means, then (according to their owne opinion) if their means be fallible, their interpretation alſo muſt be fallible. For thus Whitaker c. 3. cit. <hi>If by means, then ſuch as the means be, ſuch muſt needs the interpretation be.</hi> But the means, which Proteſtants haue, are but humane and fallible. For (as they graunt) they are no other then ſuch as the Catholik Church, holie Fathers, &amp; generall Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels haue vſed. For thus Whitaker c. 3. cit. <hi>But the means</hi> (of the Church) <hi>to expound obſcure places, are vncertaine, doubtfull, and ambiguous.</hi> And they muſt needs ſay ſo, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they muſt confeſſe, that the Church is infallible in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Scripture. Secondly, becauſe the means <note place="margin">Proteſt mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but humane.</note> which Proteſtants vſe, are theſe: Pondering of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of the ſtile and Phraſe of Scripture, conference of places, recurring to the Hebrew and Greek text, praier, and the like, as yee may ſee in Rainolds Confer. lib. 2. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſ. 2. Confeſ. Heluet. c. 2. Whitaker. Cont. 1. q. 5. c. 9. Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey ad Rat. 1. Camp. and others. But all theſe means are humane, for they be our pondering, our conference, our recurring, our praier. And all humane means are fallible, as euerie man is ſubiect to lie. Thirdly becauſe no where in Scripture is there promiſed infallible aſſiſtance to them that vſe theſe means. And if anie ſay, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to praier, whatſoeuer we aske: firſt he maketh onely praier an infallible meane. Agayne, it ſufficeth not to pray how ſoeuer, but we muſt pray well and perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantlie. For Iac. 4. v. 3. it is ſaied: <hi>Yee pray and obtayne not, becauſe yee pray ill.</hi> But it is not praied well, that euerie
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:173883:380"/> priuat man by him ſelfe should vnderſtand the Scriptures; but rather ill, becauſe the Scripture ſaieth Malac. 2. <hi>The lippes of the Prieſt keepe knowledge, and they shall require the law out of his mouth.</hi> and Epheſ. 4. <hi>He hath giuen Paſtors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for the conſumnation of Saints.</hi> Fourthly, becauſe all vſe theſe means, Catholiks, Heretiks, Iews, and yet all doe not attaine to the right ſenſe of Scripture by them.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, becauſe, Proteſtants themſelues doe inſinuate <note place="margin">Their means not infallible.</note> that theſe means are not infallible. For Whitaker beſides the words already related, ſaieth Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. 1. q. 5. c. 9. &amp; 10. <hi>That we muſt vſe theſe means rightly,</hi> and thereby declareth that theſe means are not infallible vnleſſe they be rightly vſed, and yet he doth not ſet downe the meane how to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rightly. Et c. 10. cit. addeth, <hi>that all theſe means muſt be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the rule of faith.</hi> Which be clearely enough shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that of themſelues they are not infallible. Rainolds alſo loc. cit. ſaieth: <hi>that all their means are vaine. Vnleſſe God giue eyes to ſee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtlie, theſe means are not onelie fallible, but alſo inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. <note place="margin">Their means not common to all.</note> For we muſt not onelie know to conferre places, but alſo what places are to be conferred, and what not, and with what places they are to be conferred, and with what not. Beſides, we muſt know how we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferre. For otherwiſe (as Tertullian ſaied of examining Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) we may ſay of conferring: <hi>As if hauing ill examined all, we may not fall into error, by making choice of ſome euill.</hi> But the foreſaied means teach vs not this.</p>
               <p>Finally, theſe means are not common to all the faithfull. For thus writeth Whitaker c. 9. cit. <hi>The vnlearned know not how to vſe theſe means rightly:</hi> and Rainolds libr. cit. cap. 5. diuiſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe the infirme and vnlearned ſorte of Christians haue no skill to diſcerne the right ſenſe of Scripture from the falſe, he</hi> (Vincent) <hi>accommodateth himſelfe to their infirmitie, and giueth them externall ſenſible means to know it.</hi> I aske therefore, whether vnlearned Proteſtants do truely know the right ſenſe of Scripture by means, or without means? If without means? they are Enthuſiaſts. If by
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:173883:380"/> means, there are others then thoſe which Proteſtants aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. I let paſſe, that the Lutherans ſay, that the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries had their expoſition of the Scripture fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Diuell, and that Luther profeſſeth that he was taught of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: as perhaps we shall proue an other time at large.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thus I make my 28. argument. They who in ſo manie and weightie matters do expreſſely contradict ſuch plaine words of Scripture, and yet haue no infallible way to attaine to the true ſenſe thereof, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the true ſenſe of Scripture. But Proteſtants be ſuch. Therefore &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THE 29. Argument wherewith we will proue, that Proteſtants are againſt the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, shalbe, becauſe their doctrine is ſo plainelie againſt Scripture, as they dare not admit anie Iudge thereof.

               <p>But that there muſt needs be admitted a iudge in the Church to whoſe iudgement we muſt ſtand, I proue: Firſt out of Scripture. For Deut. 17. it is ſaied: <hi>If thou perceaue that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">There muſt needs be a Iudge.</note> 
                  <hi>the iudgement with thee be hard and doubtfull thou shalt come to the Preiſts of the leuiticall ſtock and to the Iudge that shalbe at that time, and thou shalt aske of them who shall shew thee the trueth of the iudgement, and thou shalt doe whatſoeuer they that are preſidents of the place, which our Lord shall chuſe, shall ſay and teach thee according to the law and shalt follow their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, nether shalt thou decline to the right hand, nor to the left hand. But he that shalbe proud refuſing to obey the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Preiſt, who at that time miniſtreth to our Lord thy God, and the decree of the Iudge, that man shall die.</hi> Behould a Iudge inſtituted in the Church vnder the law, and him to be obeyed vnder paine of death. Likewiſe Math. 18. Chriſt ſaieth: <hi>If he will not heare the Church, let him be to the as an Ethnik and Publican.</hi> And Actor. 15. When the Chriſtians did diſagree about the obſeruation of Iewish ceremonies, <hi>they apointed that Paul and Barnabas should goe vp, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine others of the rest, to the Apostles, and Preiſts in Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem vpon this queſtion,</hi> and all true Chriſtians ſubmitted themſelues to their decree, and S. Paul commanded it to be kept. And the like practiſe hath beene euer obſerued in the Church, and they held for Heretiks who did not ſubmit themſelues to the iudgement of a lawfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
               <p>Secondely I proue it out of the Fathers. For thus S. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian Epiſt. 55. <hi>For nether are Hereſies riſen or Schiſmes ſprung from anie other roote, then becauſe the Preiſt of God is not obeyed, nor beleiued that there is one preiſt for a time in the Church, and one Iudge for a time in ſteed of Chriſt.</hi> Loe to denie, that there is a iudge in the Church in ſteed of Chriſt, is the occaſion of all Hereſies and Schiſmes. And
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:173883:381"/> S. Auſtin l. 1. cont. Creſcon. c. 33. <hi>Whoſoeuer feareth to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in the obſcuritie of this queſtion, let him aske the Church of it, whome the holie Scripture doth shew without anie doubt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe it was euer the cuſtome of Heretiks <note place="margin">Heretiks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a Iudge.</note> to denie, that there is a Iudge in the Church. Whereupon the Donatiſts in Breuic. Collat. ſay that <hi>Chriſt muſt be the iudge of this cauſe, stirring vp enuie to Catholiks becauſe they had requeſted a man to be iudge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthlie, I proue it by reaſon, becauſe it is a plaine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of an euill cauſe, that the Patrons thereof dare not ſubmit it to the iudgment of anie Iudge in the common wealth. Beſides, there can be no peace in anie ſocietie or commonwealth, vnleſſe beſide the laws, there be ſome Iudge, who may determine matters, and to whoſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment men muſt ſtand. And who denie ſuch Iudges, ether mantaine an ill cauſe, or loue not peace, but continuall braules.</p>
               <p>For theſe and the like arguments, Proteſtants ſometime <note place="margin">Proteſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time admit a Iudge in Words.</note> in words doe admitt a Iudge in the Church. For thus Whitaker Cont. 1. q. 5. c. 4. <hi>I confeſſe, that in euerie common wealth there ought to be Iudges, who may make an end of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions amongst men.</hi> Et c. 7. <hi>God indeed hath left a Iudge to his Church, but who it is, now is queſtion and debate betwene vs and the Papiſts.</hi> Elienſis. cap. 14. cit. <hi>But beſide the law, there is need of another liuely Iudge. Who denieth that?</hi> Melancthon in Reſp. ad Ant. Bauar. tom. 3. <hi>We openly confeſſe, that there muſt be iudgments in the Church.</hi> But indeed they will haue the Scripture onelie to be this Iudge: For thus Zuinglius. diſput. 1. to. 1. <hi>I will neuer admit any other iudges beſide the holie Scriptures.</hi> Which is in word to admit a Iudge, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">But not in effect.</note> to denie him. For the Scripture is the law of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and therefore not their Iudge, who is to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence according to the law. And the Lutherans in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loq. Ratisbon. ſeſſ 1. when they had ſaied, that Scripture <hi>is the rule and ſquare of faith,</hi> afterward doe adde: <hi>It is one thing to shew the Iudge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> another, to shew the rule;</hi> Wherein they plainelie diſtinguish the Scripture and the Iudge.
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:173883:382"/> Moreouer the teſtimonies of Scriptures, of Fathers, and the reaſons before alledged do proue, that there muſt be a liuelie or ſpeaking Iudge in the Church, which is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the law or Scripture. Finallie it is fond, to make <note place="margin">Proteſt iudge can nether heare nor ſpeake.</note> ſuch a Iudge, and him onely, who is both deafe and du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be, and who can nether heare thoſe that contend, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſentence, nor compell them to obey it. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more (as hath beene often ſaied) in moſt controuerſies betwixt vs and Proteſtants, Scripture doth not ſo much as ſeeme to giue ſentence for Proteſtants, vnleſſe it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by them and ioyned with ſome humane principle, and brought into ſillogiſticall forme. Whereas a Iudge muſt be ſuch, as by himſelfe without anie helpe of ether of the parties, he can giue ſentence. Beſides, the ſentence of the Iudge, and eſpeciallie if there can be no appeale from him, muſt be ſo cleare, as no man can doubt for whether partie it is; But ſuch is not the ſentence of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in manie controuerſies. Agayne there is controuerſie betwene vs about diuers bookes, of which the reſt of the Scripture ſaieth nothing. Finallie, before Moiſes, the Church had no Scripture, and for ſometime after Chriſt, it had no parte of the new teſtament, and yet she neuer wanted a Iudge. And (as we ſaw in the Chapter before) Proteſtants confeſſe, that Scripture of it ſelfe is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to determine all controuerſies of faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to iudge all. Wherefore we muſt needs haue ſome other Iudge.</p>
               <p>For theſe and the like cauſes ſome Proteſtants ſeing how abſurd it is, that Scripture is the onely Iudge in the Church, ſay that Chriſt or the holie Ghoſt ſpeaking in the Scripture, is the Iudge. Whitaker c. 7. cit. <hi>We ſay, that this Iudge is the holie Ghoſt ſpeaking in the Scripture.</hi> In like ſorte Confeſ. Heluet. c. 12. Academia Nemaus: loc. cit. Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans in Colloq. Ratisb. ſeſſ. 9. and others. But ſeing Chriſt or the holie Ghoſt is no otherwiſe in the Scripture, then as in a ſigne of his will, to ſay that the holie Ghoſt as he is in Scripture is Iudge, is no other thing indeed, then to ſay
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:173883:382"/> that the Scripture is iudge. And as the King, as he is in his written laws, is not a ſufficient iudge of the common wealth, becauſe els eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his death he should be iudge, but beſides there muſt be a liuing iudge who both heareth and ſpeaketh, who can heare the parties and giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: So nether is the holie Ghoſt a ſufficient iudge is in the holie Scripture.</p>
               <p>Others therefore acknowledge, that there muſt be in the Church a ſpeaking iudge or man. For thus Elienſis loc. cit. <hi>Wherefore we all of long time demand a free and lawfull ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Proteſt. admit a liuing Iudge in words.</note> And Lutherans in Colloq. cit. ſeſſ. 9. <hi>We profeſſe, that God hath giuen ſome power to the Miniſters and Doctors of the Church, to iudge of controuerſies of religion.</hi> Neuertheleſſe in trueth they denie the verie nature of the Iudge.

Wherefore in this Courte we may not appeale from the Iudge of the Church, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there would neuer be peace of conſcience. Thirdly, the practiſe of the Church in the Councell of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and in other generall Councels, sheweth, that the Iudge of the Church hath power to end controuerſies euen in the inward courte of conſcience. Finallie, if one were bound to obey the iudgement of the Church in the outward Courte, and not in the inward, it would follow that ſometimes he were bound to denie Gods trueth before men, to wit, if the Church should define againſt Gods trueth. Beſides, the authoritie of the Church is ſpirituall and ouer the ſoule, and therefore her power of iudging extendeth it ſelfe euen to the inwarde Courte of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE laſt proof which we will make to shew, that Proteſtants doe contradict the true ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, shalbe taken from their owne confeſſion, wherewith ſometimes they confeſſe it implicitlie, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times plainelie and expreſſely. Implicitly they confeſſe it diuers wayes. Firſt becauſe they acknowledge, that they <note place="margin">Proteſt. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reconcile their doctrine with the Scripture.</note> know not how to reconcile their doctrine with the holie Scripture. Luther de ſeru. arbit. to. 2. fol. 466. <hi>How this is iuſt, that he</hi> (God) <hi>condemneth thoſe that deſerue it not, is now incomprehenſible: yet it is beleiued till the Sonne of man be reuealed.</hi> Et f. 486. <hi>In the light of grace it is vnanſwerable, how God condemneth him, who with all his power can doe nothing but ſinne and be guiltie. Here both the light of nature and the light of Grace teach, that it is not the fault of wretched man, but of vniuſt God.</hi> Et to. 1. f. 390. <hi>It is a wonderfull probleme: that God rewardeth iuſtice, which himſelfe reputeth iniuſtice.</hi> Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon in Rom. 9. edit. 1. <hi>This miſterie is inexplicable: that God both willeth ſinnes, and yet truelie hateth them.</hi> Peter Martyr in locis Claſſ. 1. c. 16. §. 9. <hi>It is no meruaile, that we cannot vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, how it is not contrarie to Gods iuſtice to punish ſinnes, and by tempting to enforce them, becauſe God can doe more then we can vnderſtand.</hi> Caluin 1.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate deſire to Chriſt.

               <p>The third way by which they tacitelie confeſſe, that <note place="margin">Proteſt forced to denie their doctrine.</note> their doctrine is contrarie to Scripture is, becauſe when it maketh for their purpoſe, they denie that they teach manie of thoſe points which in the former booke we haue clearelie shewed that they plainelie teach. And becauſe they do this ſo frequentlie, as I need not bring manie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples thereof, I will here cite onelie ſome few. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching God: Pareus thus writeth Colleg.

Hiſtor. <hi>Be they accurſed, who will haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be exhibited here but a ſigne and figure.</hi> And Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. himſelfe. <hi>Our men neuer denied, that the bodie of Chriſt was truely in their Supper.</hi> Beza l. qq. ſaieth, that it is a ſlander, that they exclude Chriſt from their Supper.

Of good works thus Tilenus in Syntag. cap. 46. <hi>It is a cruell ſlander of our aduerſaries, where they feigne, that we teach, that all the works of the iust be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and ſimply ſinnes.</hi> Et Riuet. tract. 3. ſect. 31. <hi>None of ours ſaieth abſolutely, that all works are ſinne, nether ſay we, that they are mingled with ſinne abſolutely.</hi> See the contrarie lib. 1. c. 14. art. 2.</p>

Now all and the onelie pretext of Proteſtants touching the Scripture is taken away. For who, vnleſſe he will shut his eyes, doth not ſee, but that they are moſt plainelie condemned of the Scripture, who are condemned of it in ſo manie, and ſo weightie articles, in ſuch plaine words, and ſo cleare ſenſe, and that it is but a vaine ſtrugling to ſeek to obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the clearneſſe of ſuch a ſentence by humane gloſſes and expoſitions, ſuch as were neuer wanting, nor euer wilbe wanting to anie Heretik?
